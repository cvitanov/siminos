Dear Prof. Cvitanovic,

Your manuscript, has been reviewed for publication in Chaos: An
Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science: further review and

more information.

The revised manuscript is due no later than

which is four weeks from the date of this letter.

Reviewer #1 Evaluations:
Overall Rating: Publish with revision required

Reviewer #2
Overall Rating: Publish with revision optional

Editor's Comments:
Although Referee #2 recommends "Publish with revision optional," I think
that several useful comments are made, and questions raised, in the
review. I would like you to address them, as well as those of Referee #1,
in both the revised manuscript, and point by point in a response letter.
Also, it would substantially ease the referees' second review if you
would indicate clearly, perhaps with colored text, all the revised
passages in the paper, including figure captions (minor changes,
spelling, punctuation, excepted).
