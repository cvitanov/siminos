IMPORTANT: Before you save your mathematica notebooks to commit them to the
repository, please click on menu Cell > Delete All Output. This will
remove all graphics and output expressions and render much smaller files
that are much easier for subversion and my slow internet connection to
handle. We can always execute your notebooks to see the output. If
something cannot run in a matter of minutes you need to export the
results anyway.



PlotCL.nb plots any trajectory of the complex Lorenz flow.

Infinitesimal.nb plots the trajectory when the calculation is
done using the method of moving frames for the hyperplane x1=0.

Hilbert1.nb calculates the trajectory of the flow in the
coordinates of a Hilbert basis.

Hilbert2.nb calculates the trajectory of the flow in standard
coordinates then converts the resulting flow into the
coordinates of a Hilbert basis.

Eig.nb calculates the eigensystem of the relative equilibrium
of the complex Lorenz system in the co-moving frame.

rpoNewton.nb uses Newton's Method to find relative periodic
orbits for the complex Lorenz equations.

Rotation.nb is a program that checks how often and when a
trajectory in a slice has its group tangent also in the slice.

Poincare.nb calculates a Poincare return map using the Hilbert
polynomial coordinate frame and the slice u1=u4.

cLePoincare.nb calculates the Poincare return map using the
slice normal to {1,0,0,0,0} and poincare section x2=x4. The
method for calculating distance is more accurate than in
Poincare.nb

Fig_CmplxContour.m
from 1998 Cvitanovic, Hansen, Rolf and Vattay\rf{sumRules}
~predrag/programs/mathematica/contour :
	an example of
badly labelled figure generated by Mathematica (all fonts
should be bigger)
	there might be more stuff in repository vaggelis:
	vaggelis/production/KS22.0/equil/plot*.nb
	However, none of that seems to work in Mathematica 6.*
	ES: These are old files, I've used them to automate
		plotting relative periodic orbits by the
		hundreds. They need some work to become
		compatible with Mathematica 6 or 7 but I don't
		know if they will be good as examples.

Fig_singpass.nb creates a figure of a trajectory passing
through a singularity, a nearby trajectory which does not pass
through the singularity, and the group orbit of the singularity
point.

plots.nb creates three figures used to demonstrate what happens
to trajectories near a singularity

PaperPlotter.nb creates figures used in the paper.
