Symmetry reduction by the method of slices quotients the continuous
symmetries of chaotic flows by replacing the original state space by a
set of charts, each covering a neighborhood of a dynamically important
class of solutions, qualitatively captured by a `template'. Together
these charts provide an atlas of the symmetry-reduced `slice' of state
space, charting the regions of the manifold explored by the trajectories
of interest. Within the slice, relative equilibria reduce to equilibria
and relative periodic orbits reduce to periodic orbits. Visualizations of
these solutions and their unstable manifolds reveal their interrelations
and the role they play in organizing turbulence/chaos. These charts
