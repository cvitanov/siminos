\chapter{Lyapunov vectors}
\label{s:LyapunovVec}

This part of the blog focuses on the use of `covariant Lyapunov
vectors' (CLV) to identify the number of degrees of freedom
that capture the physics of a `turbulent' PDE on a spatial
domain. Currently that number seems to be proportional to the
system size, for \KSe\ roughly four times the number of
 positive/marginal Lyapunov exponents, and twice its
Kaplan-Yorke estimate.

As material is written up, parts of it will migrate from its
current placement into coherent sections, suitable for
inclusion into ChaosBook.org, or, God Forbid, actual {\em
publications}.
