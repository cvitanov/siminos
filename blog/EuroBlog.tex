%{\em \underline{Preamble:} My gut tells me that the method
%of moving frames, as described in the Section 4.2 of the
%thesis will \underline{not} work for KS.  But since my brain
%is dafter than my gut, I cannot explain why I feel that way.
%So, in order to make progress in this direction, I'm going to
%work with a dynamical system similar to KS, but much simpler.
%If I can figure out how to apply the moving frames to this
%system, then I can do it for KS as well.  If not, then I hope
%it will help me understand why my gut is right. \vspace{2ex}}

\medskip\noindent{\bf [2009-08-26 Ruslan]}
Forget \KS, let's consider a simpler dynamical system.
Let us say that, just like KS, we have a dynamical system on the space of real function $u(x,t)$ periodic in $x \in [-\pi, \pi)$, i.e. $u(x+2\pi,t) = u(x,t)$.  In the Fourier space $a = \mathcal{F}[u]$, $a = (a_1, a_2, \ldots)$, $a_k \in \mathbb{C}$ and $a_{-k} = a_k^\ast$.
I will also use polar coordinates, so $a_k = r_k \mathrm{e}^{i \phi_k}$.
The action of $\Un{1}$ on $u(x,t)$ is $g(\theta) u(x,t) = u(x+\theta,t)$. In the Fourier space
\[ g(\theta) a_k = \mathrm{e}^{ik\theta}a_k\,, \]
%In polar coordinates $\tau_{\shift/L} (r_k, \theta_k) = (r_k, \theta_k + q_k \shift)$.
To define the $\Un{1}$ group rotation tangent $t(a)$, we consider an infinitesimal rotation
\[ \mathrm{e}^{ik\theta}a_k = (1 + ik\theta)a_k  = a_k + \theta t_k\,, \]
so $t_k = ika_k$.
In matrix notation, $\mathbf{T} = \mathrm{diag}(ik)$,
    so  $t = \mathbf{T}a$.

The equation defining the slice through some point $\slicep$ is
\[ (\bar{a} - \sliceTan{}) \cdot \sliceTan{} = 0 \]
By the dot product we mean
\[ a \cdot b = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty a_k b_k^*\,, \]
which in the space of real periodic functions corresponds to
\[ f \cdot g = \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) g(x) dx\,, \]
where $f(x) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[a]$ and $g(x) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[b]$,
so this makes sense.  But note that this is not
the only way of defining the dot product.

\subsection{2009-08-26 Epicycles: 2-Fourier modes}
\label{sect:epyc2Fourier}

\medskip\noindent{\bf Ruslan}
Let us define a 2-Fourier modes linear dynamical system
$\dot{a}_k = v_k(a)$ as follows: $v_k = i \omega_k a_k$,
$\omega_{-k} = -\omega_k$, where $\omega_k \in \mathbb{R}$ are
constants.
\\{\bf Ruslan} $\omega_{-k} = -\omega_k$.
    I used this in my derivation to get the sign right.\\
    {\bf Predrag} Agreed - I used that too in rederiving your model.
This
\HREF{http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AddingEpicycles}
     {``epicycles'' model}
is a linear dynamical system, so we can solve it analytically:
\[ a_k(t) = a_k(0) \mathrm{e}^{i \omega_k t} \]
Even simpler, I'm going to use only the first two modes, so $a_k(0) = 0$ for all $|k| \neq 1$ or 2.

We can choose constants $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ such that this system can have
a traveling wave or a RPOs in the original space of periodic functions $u(x,t)$.\\
{\bf Example 1: \Reqv.} If $\omega_1 = c$ and $\omega_2 = 2c$, then
\[ a_k(t) = a_k(0) \mathrm{e}^{ikct} = g(ct) a_k(0)\,, \]
which is a wave traveling with speed $c$.\\
{\bf Example 2: \Rpo.} For the system to have an RPO, we can choose, for example,
$\omega_1 = \pi/2$ and $\omega_2 = 3\pi$.  This RPO has period $T = 1$ and shift $\pi/2$, since
\[ a_1(1) = a_1(0) \mathrm{e}^{i\pi/2} = g(\pi/2) a_1(0) \quad \mathrm{and} \quad
   a_2(1) = a_2(0) \mathrm{e}^{i3\pi} = a_2(0) \mathrm{e}^{i\pi} = g(\pi/2) a_2(0) \]

Let us now see what happens if we apply the method of slices to these two examples.
The reconstruction equation is
\[ \dot{\theta} = \frac{v(\bar{a}) \cdot \sliceTan{}}{t(\bar{a}) \cdot \sliceTan{}} \]
Let us say the initial condition $a_1(0) = r_1 > 0$, $a_2(0) = r_2 > 0$
(i.e. $\phi_1 = \phi_2 = 0$) is also the point $\slicep$ defining the slice.  Then
$\sliceTan{k} = ikr_k$ when $|k| = 1,2$ and zero otherwise.  So,
\beq
\dot{\theta} = \frac{\sum_k (i\omega_k \bar{a}_k) (ikr_k)^*}{\sum_k (i k \bar{a}_k)(ikr_k)^*}
                = \frac{\sum_k k \omega_k \bar{a}_k r_k}{\sum_k k^2 \bar{a}_k r_k}
\ee{RLDrec}
The equation for the flow on the slice (aka reduced flow) is
\beq
\dot{\bar{a}}_k = v_k(\bar{a}) - \frac{v(\bar{a}) \cdot \sliceTan{}}{t(\bar{a}) \cdot \sliceTan{}} t(\bar{a})
                   = i\omega_k \bar{a}_k - \frac{\sum_k k \omega_k \bar{a}_k r_k}{\sum_k k^2 \bar{a}_k r_k} ik\bar{a}_k\,.
\ee{RLDred}
\medskip\noindent{\bf Predrag}
I have coded \texttt{wilczak/matematica/PCruslan.nb} also for
$\slicep$ complex, if we need it - no reason to chose it real,
though experimentally it seems not to be the cause of the singularity in
$d\theta/dt$.

\noindent {\bf Example 1: \Reqv.} Here $\omega_k = kc$, so we immediately get
\[ \dot{\theta} = c \quad \mathrm{and} \quad \dot{\bar{a}}_k = 0\,, \]
as expected for the traveling wave.\\
{\bf Example 2:  \Rpo.} In general, for the flow with two non-zero
modes (remembering that $a_{-k} = a_k^*$ and $\omega_{-k} =
-\omega_k$):
\beq
 \dot{\theta} = \frac{\omega_1 r_1 (\bar{a}_1 + \bar{a}_1^*)
                  + 2\omega_2 r_2 (\bar{a}_2 + \bar{a}_2^*)
                  }{r_1(\bar{a}_1 + \bar{a}_1^*) + 4r_2 (\bar{a}_2 + \bar{a}_2^*)}
\ee{Period1}
and
\[ \dot{\bar{a}}_k = i\omega_k \bar{a}_k - \frac{\omega_1 r_1 (\bar{a}_1 + \bar{a}_1^*) + 2\omega_2 r_2 (\bar{a}_2 + \bar{a}_2^*)}{r_1(\bar{a}_1 + \bar{a}_1^*) + 4r_2 (\bar{a}_2 + \bar{a}_2^*)}ik\bar{a}_k \]
When $\omega_1 = \pi/2$ and $\omega_2 = 3\pi$, the second equation should generate a periodic orbit with period $T = 1$, while the solution of the first equation, starting with $\theta(0) = 0$, should give us $\theta(1) = \pi/2$.  Unfortunately, we cannot solve these equations analytically, so I'll do it numerically for different values of $r_{1,2}$.  I'll set $r_1 = 1$ and increase $r_2$ from zero.  Note that when $r_2 = 0$, we just have a traveling wave with speed $\omega_1$.  Also, when $r_2$ is sufficiently smaller than $r_1$, we will have a traveling wave slightly modulated by the 2nd mode.  This case is shown in the figure below:

\vspace{2ex}\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sliceflow1}

So, everything works well: the reduced orbit is periodic (the beginning of the orbit is denoted by the red circle, while the end is denoted by the black asterisk), and the phase shift at $t = 1$ is equal to $\pi/2$.  We can see similar picture when we increase $r_2$:

\vspace{2ex}\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sliceflow2}

Now, when $r_2$ approaches 0.5, it is clear that the orbit approaches a singularity:

\vspace{2ex}\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sliceflow3}

At $r_2 = 0.5$ we get rubbish:

\vspace{2ex}\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sliceflow4}

which persists for awhile

\vspace{2ex}\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sliceflow5}

until we get back the nice smooth solution:

\vspace{2ex}\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sliceflow6}

which, however, is no longer periodic, while the shift is now $3\pi/2$.  This picture persists for all $r_2 > r_1$.

\vspace{2ex}\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sliceflow7}

So, it looks like the problem with the method of slices is not only due to running into the singularities,
but also due to the possibility of generating smooth orbits which go around those singularities
and generate wrong shifts without any indication that something has gone wrong.
These orbits are no longer periodic in the reduced space.  The only time this method works
reliably is when the flow is dominated by the first Fourier mode.  If this is not the case,
as in the KSE regime with multiple active modes, then we cannot expect that it will work.~~{\em Q.E.D.}

\vspace{2ex}
An old idea presented as a new one:  Why don't we define the dot product in the above equations as follows:
\beq
 a \cdot b = a_1 b_1^* + a_1^* b_1
 \,.
\ee{RLDfix}
Then, if I'm not mistaken, the whole thing reduces to my original idea for factoring out the $\Un{1}$
symmetry from the KS flow.  In this case we won't need to worry about running into, or moving around,
the singularities while generating spurious phases.  The only singularity will be at $r_1 = 0$,
which is trivial to deal with.

With the dot product defined as in \refeq{RLDfix},
\refeq{RLDrec} and \refeq{RLDred} become
\[
  \dot{\theta} = \omega_1
  \quad \mathrm{and} \quad
  \dot{\bar{a}}_k = i(\omega_k - k\omega_1) \bar{a}_k
\,.
\]
So they (obvious to Ruslan) do the job.


\subsection{2009-08-25 Eurosceptics do not like to slice}
\label{2009-08-25Eurosceptics}

\noindent{\bf Ruslan} (Predrag's translation) one gets a
phase shift by $\pi$ if one crosses the singularity.
\\
{\bf Ruslan} The shifts by $\pi$ is the least of my worries.
It is the fact that when $r_2 > r_1$ we get a nice smooth
solution of the reconstruction and reduced equations, yet we
get obviously wrong results.  I don't want to think why this
is happening.  I'd rather just stop using the approach where
such a thing can happen.
\\
{\bf Predrag} Your model illustrates why we need
monotonicity in phase (we are integrating 1d equation,
velocity cannot change sign?). But I think we will fix it -
it is like WKB for harmonic oscillator, one gets geometric
$\pi$ phase for each turn, and a neat way to do it is Maslov
trick - change slice at $\pi/4$, then change back at
$3\pi/4$, etc. Looks like something we can figure out. Sure
cute - getting semiclassical Keller-Maslov phase without
doing neither wave nor quantum mechanics. At least, not
consciously.

More interesting will be the phase for the method of
connections. If we are lucky, it is the same for relative
periodic orbits.
\\
{\bf Ruslan} We had the discussion about monotonicity some
time ago (see above).  I don't have anything more to add at
the moment.
\\
I don't know much about WKB, or Keller-Maslov
phase, but I would like to get away from generating all kinds
of fixes, like using random $\slicep$ or switching between
slices.

\medskip\noindent{\bf Predrag} 1st mode will not work. Actually,
what Ruslan has run into so far is the same problem you
(Evangelos) and Rebecca run into independently; he is
measuring angle in polar coordinates, where we also run into
$d\theta/dt$ divergence, and shifts by $\pi$.
\\
{\bf Ruslan} I disagree that 1st mode won't work, I think it
will. And I don't think using polar coordinates is the
problem.  Forget about dynamics.  Just look at functions
defined on a circle and ask yourself how to identify
functions that differ only by a shift.  My answer: The phase
of the 1st Fourier mode will give you the shift.  So just use
it to rotate the functions on top of each other.

\noindent {\bf Evangelos} Apart from quantum mechanics there
are classical systems that exhibit such behavior, see for
example
\HREF{dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.034301}
{this PRL paper}. I've only seen it in Hamiltonian systems,
where this behavior is called monodromy since one studies the
system as it goes once around a singularity (is the etymology
clear to non-Greeks too?). It apparently arises when a
function fails to be single-valued, which again should point
out why we need monotonicity in phase.\\
\textit{Question for Ruslan} Is it really trivial to deal
with the singularity at $r_1=0$?\\
{\bf Ruslan} Yes, but you should never ever try to
numerically integrate the reconstruction or the reduced flow
equations if you expect to get the correct reduced
representation of the orbits of the original flow.  Instead,
integrate the original flow and then pull the obtained orbit
onto the slice while keeping track of the shift you generate
while doing it.  If the original orbit goes exactly through
$r_1 = 0$ (within the round-off error), then add (or
subtract) $\pi$.  That's all.\\
{\bf Evangelos}  I agree that integrating the equation on the
slice is not the safest think to do. I would like to
understand where the spurious shifts that you have discovered
come from, though. It looks like the reduced space has a
branch cut and as one integrates the equations around the
singularity he finds oneself on a different leaf.

There is something I don't understand in the procedure you
describe here. Does the need to add or subtract $\pi$ come
from the fact that most implementations of $arg$ or $arctan$
functions do not distinguish quadrants? I do not understand
how else it is connected to crossing through $r_1 = 0$ or why
it does take care of the singularity. You can approach the
singularity through any direction on the $a_1$ plane, so the
way to overcome the singularity on a point with $r_1=0$ seems
to be to use the angle at which you approach to it (that you
get from the previous point) to correctly rotate it onto the
slice. The difficulty is that then you are not able to tell
where $\EQV{2}$ and $\EQV{3}$ lie on this space as they both
have $r_1=0$: their group orbits do not intersect your slice,
so you do need another ``coordinate chart'' to cover the
space.
\\
{\bf Evangelos} You still need to cover the reduced space
with more than one coordinate systems which is essentially
the same as choosing a new slice.\\
{\bf Ruslan} No. You don't need more than one coordinate
system.  Just use the Fourier modes as reduced coordinates,
with the phase of the 1st mode fixed.  The phase of the 1st
mode will be the reconstruction shift.\\
{\bf Evangelos} Even if this doesn't bother us, I am afraid
that we will get projections that are not more informative
than Figure 42 in today's version of my thesis, where the
singularity was dealt with but $\EQV{2}$ and $\EQV{3}$
collapse to the same point.\\
{\bf Ruslan} I cannot guarantee that the pictures we get
will be nice and simple.  Of course, since the reduced space
is a semi-space (because $r_1 \geq 0$), the reduced orbits
may not always look pretty and smooth: They will have sharp
turns when they come close to, or hit, the $r_1 = 0$
subspace.  But at least when I look at orbits projected onto
Fourier modes, I know how to interpret them.  When I'm
looking at the projections onto some exotic curvilinear
coordinates, the pictures make no sense to me.\\
{\bf Evangelos} On the utility of Fourier modes as a
representation I disagree in two levels. I anyway find that
Fourier modes projection tell us very little about dynamics.
Wasn't this the reason to use different coordinate systems in
the KS paper? So as long we can construct dynamically
meaningful projections in the new variables I do not worry
how we got them.

Furthermore, what you describe above is equivalent to using
the invariants of Table 3 in Chapter 8 in my thesis. The new
coordinates are exactly the Fourier modes rotated back to the
slice defined by $\Im(c_1)=0$, this is how they were
obtained. The difference is that in Table 3 the singularity
is explicit. The important point though is that what you like
to see as a linear transformation is in fact a nonlinear
transformation through the dependance of the angle on the
point in space in which it is evaluated. Whereas in a linear
transformation all points in space are rotated by the same
angle. Therefore without knowing it you use exotic
curvilinear coordinates. The connection to the original
Fourier modes is that the magnitude in each Fourier plane
stays invariant. Of course things get even more exotic in my
thesis, but the motivation behind that was to get projections
that provide more information about the dynamics.

As a general comment, it appears that when we try to see the
reduced space as embedded in the original space, no matter
how we go from $N$ to $N-1$ dimensions we impose a
conservation law that did not exist in the original system
(as it was allowed to have motion in the direction of group
action) that restricts the motion to an $N-1$ dimensional
space which cannot in general be given a nice structure.

\subsection{2009-08-26 Eurosceptics carry the day}
\label{sect:2009-08-26}

\noindent{\bf Predrag} OK, now that Ruslan has gone on
strike I spent a day screwing around with Mathematica,
checked epicyclist formulas and reproduced Ruslan's graphs.
As I am using \texttt{NDsolve[\dots]} as a black box, I do
not get the same screwy details close to $(r_1,r_2)=(1,0.5)$,
but the result is the same - for $r_2$ sufficiently larger
than 1/2 one gets extra $\pi$ shift, with no integration hint
that one is going around a singularity. That is unacceptable.
As Ruslan expects,
random choices of complex (not real) \slice\ fixing
point $\sliceTan{}$ move the singularity around but are essentially no
help.

I will still try to use Maslov trick and switch the slice
whenever $\dot{\theta}$ starts misbehaving, but for that I
need to learn how to use \texttt{Method -> \{"EventLocator"}
within \texttt{NDsolve[\dots]}, but that sure looks like a
bitter pill. I do not mind having several slices as long as
the returns to (dynamical) \PoincSec s trace out
smooth unstable manifolds suitable to partitioning the
\reducedsp.

Marsdenites did not note this problem as they only applied
the method to \reqva, and there it is OK.

I agree that if one is to fix the \slice\ by one Fourier
mode, \refeq{RLDfix} is the most natural choice, and would be
easiest to explain in a publication. Unfortunately, we ran
into singularities when we tried it for \CLe\ in Siminos
thesis\rf{SiminosThesis} and
\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/projects}
     {Rebecca's summer project}.
But Ruslan, please do give it a try.

\medskip\noindent{\bf Ruslan}
Actually, not really on strike, just reluctant to participate
in your, what I believe to be, futile efforts to apply all
kinds of fixes and patches to the approach which, I believe,
is fundamentally incurable when it comes to systems like KS
in a fully developed chaotic regime. [\dots]

\medskip\noindent{\bf Predrag} Fair enough - way too many fixes and
patches. We need to quotient the symmetry in order to figure
out the symbolic dynamics for KS and for plane Couette and
pipe flows. If something like \refeq{RLDfix} works it would
be nicer. The reason why we think it will not is that when we
use the polar coordinates-inspired \slice\ fixing point
$\ssp^{*}=(0+i,0, \cdots)$, $\Re\ssp_1=0,\;\\Im\ssp_1>0$
(which I believe for $\Un{1}$ version corresponds to fixing the
phase of the first Fourier mode) the \reducedsp\ equations
are given by
\beq
\dot{\ssp} = v - \frac{{\Im} v_1}{{\Re}\ssp_1} t(\ssp)
\,.
\ee{EqMotionMovFrame}
Trajectories shown in %\reffig{fig:PCunrot1}
Siminos thesis\rf{SiminosThesis} and
\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/projects}
     {Rebecca's summer project}
exhibit jumps by $\pi$. With $\ssp^{*}$ on \reqv\ orbit we
were luckier, and got a strange attractor which encountered
no $\dot{\theta}$ singularity. But unhappy, as we did not
understand why we were lucky.

\subsection{2009-08-27 Don't worry. Be happy}

\begin{description}
\item[Ruslan]
    Let me start by answering Evangelos's question about rotation
by $\pi$.  Forget about multiple modes for the moment.  Just
consider evolution of the first mode: $a_1(t) =
r_1(t)\mathrm{e}^{i\phi_1(t)} \in \mathbb{C}$.  If $a_1(t)$
goes through zero, then $r_1(t)$ bounces off of zero, while
$\phi_1(t)$ changes by $\pi$ or $-\pi$, (the sign is
immaterial).   This is just the nature of the polar
coordinates and has nothing to do with the implementation of
$arg$.

\item[Evangelos]
But still I don't understand why would you need to add or subtract
$\pi$? Doesn't the function you use to calculate the angle in this
plane take care of that?

\item[Ruslan]
That's it.  All I was saying
was that $\phi_1$ would change by $\pi$ or $-\pi$ as $a_1$
crosses zero.  And that's what the angle function would give
you.  Nothing else needs to be added.

\item[Ruslan]
Now about the nature of what you call the 'singularity'.  If
I understand it correctly, what worries you is that, if we
take $\phi_1$ as our $\theta$, then each time it changes by
$\pi$, the $k$-th mode needs to be changed by $k\pi$, $k >
1$.  You perceive this as a jump, i.e. a discontinuity of the
reduced orbit, which you don't like.  Is this what you mean
by the 'singularity'? If `yes', then do you really need to
worry about it?

\item[Predrag]
If $1/x$ is considered a
`singularity' for $x=0$ on small islands off Continent, than
we will be so bold to call it singularity. As you say, there
should be simple analytic fixes for going through zero; we
have to make sure that we teach our numerical routines how to
implement this. Your pretty and clean epicycle model just
gave me a new set of ulcers, as for $r_2$ not very larger
than 1/2 the integrators seem not to know that there was any
singularity at all, and relative periodic orbits became
periodic only mod~$\pi$. And $\pi$ or $-\pi$  sign is not
immaterial - we have to get \rpo s shifts right.

\item[Evangelos]
I want to add that the singularities in expressions such as
in Table 3 in Chapter 8 of my
thesis cannot be essential, in the sense that, since the transformations
are generated by rotations, the expressions
cannot really blow up. In practice they pose numerical issues,
related to the small denominators in these expressions. So I agree there
should be simple analytic fixes.

\item[Ruslan]
If you think about it, what you perceive as a jump is
actually a very fast rotation (infinitely fast if you go
exactly through zero, but otherwise finitely fast).  If you
don't like that it rotates so fast, then why don't you just
rescale the time?  Just slow it down near $r_1 = 0$.  I think
something like $d\tau = dt/r_1(t)$ might work, since it will
remove $\Re\ssp_1$ from the denominator in
\refeq{EqMotionMovFrame}.

\item[Predrag]
Agreed. I have been also thinking about redefining time.
That's also in ChaosBook
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/conjug.pdf} {Chapter 6 - Get straight},
called there the
Kustaanheimo-Stiefel (also known as KS!) transformation, and
applied in Example 6.2: what to do with Keplerian ellipses of
arbitrarily large velocity. That we might need for close
passages to the $\Un{1}$ invariant subspace, with $r^2 = \sum
\ssp_k^*\ssp_k$ going small. Fortunately, in KS that never
happens - strange attractor is safely away from the $u(x)=1$
\eqv. Our problem with method of slices is more naive, as you
explain above.

Of course, the real challenge is: who will be the first to read the
\\
\HREF{ChaosBook.org/projects/siminos/thesis.pdf}
      {Thesis that Nobody Reads} first?

\item[Ruslan]
On the other hand, if our goal is to eventually reduce the
dynamics to a Poincar\'e map, then why do we need to worry
about time at all?

\item[Predrag]
Agreed - anything that gets us the sensible return (or
forward) maps is good. Just have to make numerics is correct,
and yields correct \rpo s shifts and periods - at the moment
we do not know how to do that right even for the 2-mode
epicycles model.

\item[Evangelos]
I also agree, that was my thesis final conclusion on what one should do: just
make sure that the \PoincSec\ is away from problematic regions. It is
just that finding a good section is not always easy, so one needs some visualization
that works well in order to get intuition on where to place it.

\subsection{2009-08-28 On ulcers, singularities, and `tender beasts'}

\noindent{\bf Ruslan} I thought the dot product
\refeq{RLDfix} would cure your ulcers for the epicycle model,
and I'm pretty sure for the CL and KS as well, provided you
stop worrying about the fast rotations in the reduced space.
I don't mind that you call them `singularities', but, hearing
your complaints about numerics, I'm pretty sure somebody
does...  Let me tell you something about computers: they are
tender beasts and if you say, or even think, this word in
their presence, they will get spooked and throw all kinds of
fits.  But seriously, as I already said above, any symmetry
reduction or other transformations that you want to carry out
should be done as post-processing, i.e. after you obtain your
numerical trajectory by integrating the original flow.  That
way the singularities are much more tractable numerically.

\subsection{2009-08-27 Maslov trick}
\label{s:MaslovTrick}

\noindent{\bf Predrag}  The Maslov trick is described in
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/version12/chapters/WKB.pdf}
{ChaosBook vers. 12, Chapter 31} - WKB quantization.
Now I realize I give no references to Maslov paper or other
relevant sources - if you find them, please let me know so we can
write up the remark on the Maslov approach. Citing from this
chapter:

A simple physical picture, due to Maslov, is illustrated by quantization
of the harmonic oscillator. Semi-classical propagator has
a factor $1/$(velocity$)^{1/2}$, reminiscent of our $\dot{\theta}$, and
that blows up at the turning points, points where the particle as viewed
from the $q$ coordinate frame reverses velocity.

In the $q$ coordinate, the turning points are defined by the
zero kinetic energy condition,
and the motion appears singular.
This is not so in the full \statesp: the trajectory in a smooth confining
1-dimensional potential is always a smooth loop,
with the ``special'' role of the turning points $q_L, q_R$ seen to be an
artifact of a particular choice of the $(q,p)$ coordinate frame
(in our application, choice of a slice). Maslov's
idea was to proceed from the initial point
$(q',p')$ to a point $(q_{A},p_A)$ preceding the turning
point in the $\psi(q)$
representation, then switch
to the momentum representation (in our application, use a slice turned by
$90^o$)
continue from $(q_A, p_A)$ to $(q_B, p_B)$, switch back to the coordinate
representation (in our application, use a slice turned by
$90^o$), and so on.

In other word, as slices are local, switch to the next one whenever
convenient, and for recurrent orbits, make sure you are in the original
slice when you come back, in order to get a return map and hopefully sensible
symbolic dynamics.

\subsection{2009-08-28 Any 2-mode epicycle reduces to a periodic orbit}

\begin{description}
\item[Predrag]
A generic 2-Fourier modes epicycle trajectory runs on a 2-torus in the
full \statesp. Hence any trajectory is a \po\ in the \reducedsp, not
only the hand-crafted \rpo\ such as \refeq{RLDrec}.
(I actually verified this statement by running random trajectories
in \texttt{Mathematica}, so it is true.)
For testing methods of symmetry reduction
it might be a good idea to increase the number of Fourier modes.
\item[Ruslan]
That's right.  And thinking about it
as a 2-torus might hint at why the singularity develops as
$r_2$ grows. As $r_2$ grows, at some point the torus becomes
self-intersecting. I'm sure this happens when $r_2 = r_1/2$.
The $\SOn{2}$ group orbit on this torus is a line that winds once
around $r_1$ and twice around $r_2$.  As the torus becomes
self-intersecting this orbit first self-intersects at $r_2 =
r_1/2$ and then forms a knot.  And that's why an extra $\pi$
shift appears when we try to project an orbit onto the slice
normal to this knot.  This is just a speculation, but maybe
there is something in it.

\section{2009-08-29 Kuramoto-Sivashinsky \On{2}\ quotienting}
\label{2009-08-29KS-O2}

\subsection{Back to the future: pasting from 2007-12-31}

\medskip\noindent{\bf Ruslan pasting from siminos/blog/davidchack/071231fundamental.html}
To fix the notations, let me recap the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation (KSE) and its representation in Fourier space:
\[ u_t = -uu_x - u_{xx} - u_{xxxx},  \quad x \in [-L/2, L/2] \]
with periodic boundary conditions:  $u(x+L,t) = u(x,t)$.  In the Fourier representation
\[ u(x,t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_k (t) e^{ i q_k x }\,,\]
where $ q_k = 2\pi k/L$, the KSE takes the form
\[ \dot{a}_k = v_k(a) = (q_k^2 - q_k^4)a_k - \frac{iq}{2}\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}
    a_m a_{k-m}\,,\quad a_k \in {\cal C}\]
It is convenient to represent complex modes as pairs of real
variables, either in cartesian or polar coordinates:
\[ a_k = (b_k, c_k) = b_k + ic_k = (r_k, \theta_k) = r_k e^{i\theta_k}\,. \]

\noindent{\bf Symmetries:} If $u(x,t)$ is a solution of the KSE, then so are
\[ \tau_{\shift/L} u(x,t) = u(x+\shift,t) \quad\mbox{and}\quad R\,u(x,t) = -u(-x,t).\]
The action of symmetry transformations on Fourier modes is as follows:
\[ \tau_{\shift/L} a_k = e^{iq_k \shift} a_k = (r_k, \theta_k + q_k \shift) \,,\qquad R\,a_k = -a_k^\ast = (-b_k, c_k)\,.\]

\subsubsection{Defining KSE quotient space $\pS/\On{2}$} % (a.k.a. fundamental domain)}
\label{sect:RLDslice}

The KSE quotient space $\pS/\On{2}$ is defined in Fourier space as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $r_1 > 0$ then $\theta_1 = \pi/2$ and $\dot{\theta}_1 \leq 0$;
\item if $r_1 = 0$ then $\arg \dot{a}_1 = \pi/2$;
\item if $a_1 = \dot{a}_1 = 0$ then the KSE solution lives in
        the $L/2$-periodic invariant subspace, where $\pS/\On{2}$ is
        defined as above but for the 2nd mode;
\item and so on...
\end{enumerate}
So the quotient space $\pS/\On{2}$ consists of a hierarchy of
slices fixed by the $k$-th Fourier mode for the
$L/k$-periodic invariant subspace.

\begin{description}
\item[Predrag's comment] I do not find fixing a single
Fourier coefficient natural, and you pay for it by having to
deal with discrete shift symmetry subcases separately (fixing
higher $k$ Fourier coefficients).
\item[Ruslan's reply] I think it is completely natural that
for solutions symmetric by $L/k$ shift, we use the $k$-th
Fourier mode. Since functions in $L/k$-symmetric subspace are
invariant under KS dynamics, using $k$-th Fourier Mode in
$[0, L]$ is the same as using the 1st Fourier mode in $[0,
L/k]$.  Also note that, again because of the invariance of
these subspaces, the choice of the mode which defines
$\pS/$\On{2}\ is fixed once and for all times by the initial
condition, so there is no need to jump between slices when
following the KS flow.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Mapping KSE solutions to $\pS/\SOn{2}$}

Following Predrag's suggestion, I'll split the mapping of KSE solution to
$\pS/$\On{2} into two parts:
\\
1) map to $\pS/\SOn{2}$ by translation $\tau_{\shift/L}$; 2) map from
$\pS/\SOn{2}$ to $\pS/$\On{2} by reflection $R$.

\subsection{2009-08-31 A closer look at the singularity}

\noindent{\bf Evangelos}
Taking \CLe\ as an example I will examine how the invariants
\beq
\begin{split}
        \overline{x}_2 &= \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2} \continue
        \overline{y}_1 &= \frac{x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}\continue
        \overline{y}_2 &=\frac{x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}\,.
        \label{eq:invLaser}
\end{split}
\eeq
generated by straightforward application of the moving frame method behave as $x=x_1+i x_2$ approaches
zero. For the limit to exist we must get a direction independent result as $x\rightarrow 0$.
Using $x=r_x\, e^{i\theta_x}\,,\, y=r_y\, e^{i\theta_y}$ we can write, for instance, $x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2 = r_x r_y \sin(\theta_x-\theta_y)$
and therefore,
\beq
        \overline{y}_1= r_y\sin(\theta_x-\theta_y)\,.
\eeq
Therefore, for any given $y$, the limit of $\overline{y}_1$ for $x
\rightarrow 0$ does not exist, as the above expression depends on the
direction on the complex $x$-plane along which we approach zero. In terms
of projecting dynamics on variables \refeq{eq:invLaser} (or applying the
equivalent procedure of rotating points back to the \slice) this means
that we need to take into account the direction along which we approach
zero and use the `angle of descent' as the angle with which we rotate
points back to the \slice, if such points have exactly $x=0$ (in CLE this
does not happen). Since the subspace $x=0$ is not flow invariant we do
not need to worry about dynamics that stay within the subspace. We need
to worry about the equilibria that exist in this subspace though, here
the equilibrium at the origin, as there is no way to transform them to
the new variables. For KS $\EQV{2}$ and $\EQV{3}$ belong to such a
subspace.

\begin{description}
\item[Ruslan's more optimistic view of the singularity] Of
course, when $x = 0$, the angle $\theta_x$ is undefined.  But
if you look dynamically at $x(t)$ as it crosses zero at $t =
t_0$, then you realize that if $\theta_x(t < t_0) = \theta$
then $\theta_x(t > t_0) = \theta + \pi$ and all you need to
decide is how to define $\theta_x(t_0)$.  The most natural
definition is based on the direction of $\dot{x}(t = t_0)$,
i.e. $\theta_x(t_0) = \arg \dot{x}(t_0) = \theta + \pi$.
That's the reason I have item 2 in my definition of $M/$\On{2}
quotient space.  So, as you can see, $\theta_x(t)$ remains
well defined at all times.

Regarding \EQV{2} and E3 in KS, they live in $L/2$- and
$L/3$-periodic subspaces, respectively.  So, to map them onto
$M/$\On{2}, we'll use the 2nd and 3rd Fourier modes,
respectively, as stated in items 3 and 4.

\item[Evangelos]
I agree about trajectories that cross zero, but not about
\EQV{2} and \EQV{3}. As soon as you use 2nd and 3rd Fourier
modes you effectively use different transformations, so it is
not obvious to me how you can piece everything together in
the same space. Fortunately we are not interested on dynamics
in $L/2$- and $L/3$-periodic subspaces, as they are not
invariant, but rather on how unstable manifolds of \EQV{2}
and \EQV{3} organize the $L$-periodic space. As those
unstable manifolds do not have vanishing first Fourier mode
we can visualize them and forget the equilibria.

\item[Ruslan]
  Actually, it's somewhat the other way
around for me: what worries you, does not worry me and vice
versa.  The proposed hierarchy of transformations is
completely consistent, since the higher-mode transformations
only act on those {\statesp} points which are not influenced
by the 1st mode transform.  By the way, the $L/k$-periodic
subspaces \underline{are} invariant: e.g. if $a_1(0) = 0$ and
$\dot{a}_1(0) = 0$ then $a_1(t>0) = 0$, so the solution is
$L/2$-periodic (provided $a_2(0) \neq 0$).  And finally, we
do have to keep track of the special symmetries of the
unstable manifolds of the equilibria.  For example, once
$\EQV{2}$ is placed within $M/$\On{2} using the 2-nd Fourier
mode, its unstable manifold completely lives in the
anti-symmetric subspace (i.e. $Re\,a_k = 0$). {\color{blue}
The 1st mode transformation doesn't do anything to it, since
for any point on the manifold $\theta_1 = \pi/2$ already.}
So, the manifold we show in our SIADS Fig.~5.6 is already in
$M/$\On{2}.  What worries me is that $\EQV{2}$ is represented
here by two different points ($\EQV{2}$ and
$\tau_{1/4}\EQV{2}$).  This is the result of the additional
symmetry of $\EQV{2}$.  Whether or not these two points can
be merged into one $\EQV{2}$ without loss of dynamical
information about the KS flow, remains to be investigated.

What I wrote above, highlighted in blue, is wrong.  $\SOn{2}$
still acts in the antisymmetric subspace, since the points
there can also have $\theta_1 = -\pi/2$.  So they are rotated
by $\pi$.  Whether or not this will also rotate
$\tau_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ into $\EQV{2}$ I'm not yet sure.

\item[Evangelos]
$\SOn{2}$ does not act in the antisymmetric subspace (in the
sense that it does not leave it invariant as a set) but
merely on the intersection of antisymmetric subspace and its
$\tau_{1/4}$ translated copy. The group orbits of points on
antisymmetric subspace produce a family of copies of it. One
can identify a single representative by choosing for instance
$\theta_1=\pi/2$, so I don't see any problem with points on
the unstable manifolds of $\EQV{2}$. $L/k$-periodic subspaces
\underline{are not} invariant: if $a_1(0)=0$ then in general
$\dot{a}_1(0)\neq 0$, due to the nonlinear terms. Right?

\item[Ruslan]
  I didn't quite understand your
comments about the translated copies of the antisymmetric
subspace, but if you think it's not causing any problems, I'm
happy.  Regarding the $L/k$-periodic subspaces, I guess I
wasn't defining them correctly.  So, if $\dot{a}_1 \neq 0$
then we can still map this point to $M/$\On{2} using the 1st
mode.  I was speaking then about the parts of $L/k$-periodic
subspaces which remain invariant under the KS flow.  They
need to be mapped to $M/$\On{2} using higher FMs.

\end{description}


\subsection{2009-08-29 - Implementation of Ruslan's $a_1$-fixed slice}

\noindent{\bf Evangelos}
I thought its time to shut up and compute something, so I've
implemented first part of (my interpretation of) Ruslan's
prescription for KS that should take care of $\SOn{2}$. Namely,
I have fixed the \slice\ following
the rules of \refsect{sect:RLDslice}:
\bea
\Im \bar{a}_1  &=& 0
\continue
\mbox{If } r_1 &>& 0\,,\quad \mbox{\ESedit{rotate to the \slice\ by}}
        -\arctan( \Im a_1/\Re a_1 )
\continue
\mbox{If } r_1 &=& 0\,,\quad \mbox{\ESedit{rotate to the \slice\ by}}
        -\arctan( \Im \dot{a}_1/\Re \dot{a}_1 )
\,.
\label{ES-RLDslice}
\eea


\begin{figure}
 (a)~\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{ksRotatedTW1um}\,
 (b)~\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{ksRotatedE2um}
\caption{\label{fig-2009-08-29TW1}

 Several \rpo s are shown along with the
 unstable manifolds of (a) \REQV{\pm}{1}, (b) \EQV{2}. $L=22$.
}
\end{figure}

I've posted such a figure long ago in Jonathan's blog, but
nobody got interested. I am also not happy with this figure
but one might argue that there are implementation problems,
and this is probably right, so I will have a second look.
Then, if I am to follow Ruslan's next step in the
prescription and set $\Im \bar{a}_2 =0$ in order to include
$\EQV{2}$ in this figure, the equilibrium will not ``meet''
it's unstable manifold, correct?

\begin{description}
\item[Ruslan]
 I agree that the unstable manifold of $\EQV{2}$ reduced by
 the 1st mode to $\pS/\SOn{2}$ will not meet $\EQV{2}$ reduced by
 the 2nd mode. \par I have a question: do we expect that an
 antisymmetric solution of KS will remain antisymmetric in
 $\pS/\SOn{2}$?  If yes, then we are in trouble, which has
 nothing to do with using the 1st mode: As I stated above,
 the only thing $\SOn{2}$ can do to leave an antisymmetric
 solution antisymmetric is rotate it by $\pi$.  However, in
 order for the unstable manifold of $\EQV{2}$ (which is
 antisymmetric) to return to back to $\EQV{2}$ we need the
 rotations along the orbit to add up to $-\pi/2$ (to
 compensate for the $\tau_{1/4}$ shift).  So, somewhere along
 the way the unstable manifold has to leave the antisymmetric
 subspace.  This doesn't seem natural, since antisymmetric
 subspace is invariant under KS flow.

\item[Evangelos]
If we all agree that rotating points back to the slice $\Im\
a_1=0$ is equivalent to transformations of Table 3 in Chapter
8 in my thesis (that I copy here for convenience), up to
treatment of points with $a_1=0$, then my answer would be as
follows: applying reflections generated by $b_i\mapsto - b_i$
to the $u_i$ of \reftab{tab:SO2n6} we have $u_3\mapsto -u_3$,
$u_4\mapsto u_4$, $u_5\mapsto u_5$, $u_6\mapsto -u_6$ and so
on, so that the reflection matrix $\mathbf{R}$ in new
coordinates is diagonal, with entries $\pm 1$ and therefore
satisfies $\mathbf{R}^2=1$, as it should. Points in the
antisymmetric subspace $b_i=0$ for every $i$, are mapped to
points in the new coordinates that only depend on the $c_i$'s
and are therefore invariant under reflections, \ie,
antisymmetric. I don't see why the unstable manifold in
reduced space should leave the antisymmetric subspace, since
we don't even know were the equilibria live in such a reduced
space.

    \PCedit{
\item[Evangelos: 2010-04-05]
We can compute invariants in \reftab{tab:SO2n6} at least to
dimensions of order 100, I've computed some 256 invariants
for KS. It's just pointless to use more than order 10 for
L=22. BUT: They are not a Hilbert basis for the given action
of \SOn{22}, as they do not span the space. Specifically they
do not span the discrete cyclic subgroup isotropy subspaces
$Fix(C_q)$, for any $q$, as the transformations are not
defined for $a_1=b_1=0$. This should be an example for
Cartan's moving frame method.
    }


\item[Ruslan]
Well, we do know that the unstable manifold of $\EQV{2}$
converges to $\tau_{1/4}\EQV{2}$.  And I also assume that we
want $\EQV{2}$ and $\tau_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ to be represented by
the same point in the reduced space.  So, in order to bring
these two points together in the reduced space, we need to
rotate $\tau_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ by $-\pi/2$.  This rotation needs
to occur somewhere along an orbit (a closed loop in the
reduced space) within the unstable manifold of $\EQV{2}$.
But since the antisymmetric subspace is \underline{not}
invariant wrt rotation by $-\pi/2$, the orbit must leave the
antisymmetric subspace.  Another way to put this, is that, if
we only look at KS solutions within the antisymmetric
subspace, then $\EQV{2}$ and $\tau_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ are two
\underline{distinct} equilibria, since the first one is
unstable, while the second one is stable.  So, there is no
way to map these two equilibria into the same point while
staying within the antisymmetric subspace.

I don't know how much we should care about this, but this
tells me that, no matter how we construct the reduced space,
we will not be able to retain the simple structure of the KS
invariant subspaces within the reduced space.

\item[Ruslan 2009-10-14]
I still don't see how to reconcile this: On the one hand, it
would appear natural that the antisymmetric subspace should
be a part of $\pS/\SOn{2}$, but, on the other hand, the
antisymmetric subspace contains two distinct images of
$\EQV{2}$, while, in the reduced representation of the full
KS flow, we would hope that there would be only one point for
$\EQV{2}$ in $\pS/\SOn{2}$.  I can see only two possibilities
here: either we introduce discontinuities of the flow in
$\pS/\SOn{2}$ (like it is happening with my Fourier modes
representation), or we collapse the dynamics to a subspace
that completely ignores the phase information (e.g., like in
the energy transfer representation).

\item[Predrag 2009-10-15]
Yes, please quotient the full $\pS/\On{2}$. It's good to do so,
quotienting discrete symmetries helps a lot, see
\\
\wwwcb{/chapter/discrete.pdf}.

\item[Ruslan 2009-10-14]
Since I don't like collapsing things (I would like to have a
representation where I can keep track of the phase shift
$\theta$, which will allow me to reconstruct the original
dynamics if I wish to do so), and since I don't know how to
get rid of the discontinuities otherwise, I'm going to go
crazy and embrace them.  So, my plan here is as follows:
I'll try to construct a reduced representation (and hopefully
a Poincar\'e map) for the dynamics in the vicinity of the
unstable manifold of $\EQV{2}$. I think that if I manage to
do it here, then there is hope that it can be done for the KS
flow elsewhere as well.  I may continue using the Fourier
modes, or I might try something else, like using the
real-space representation (remember those $u$-$u_x$-$u_{xx}$
plots?).

\item[Predrag 2009-10-15]
You keep track of discrete $\LieEl$ for a given full
\statesp\ trajectory by noting every time you need to apply
it, upon exit from the fundamental domain, see Lorentz flow
$\pS/\Ztwo$ Van Gogh attractor in
\wwwcb{/chapter/discrete.pdf}.


\item[Evangelos to Ruslan]
Sorry that it took so long to get back to you, I am
just not sure I follow your arguments and I am afraid there
is a danger that the discussion becomes cyclic. The
antisymmetric subspace is indeed not invariant under $\pi/2$
rotations. On the other hand the image of the unstable
manifold of \EQV{2} under symmetry reduction by
\refeq{ES-RLDslice} is unique. It belongs to a
``antisymmetric set'' in the reduced space, in which space the
action of reflections has been properly re-defined as in my
previous post. Of course the latter set is not invariant
under the action of reflection as defined in the original
space. In other words, if we would like to see the reduced
space as embedded in the original space we would have to say
that the linear antisymmetric subspace has been deformed in a
nonlinear manner through the transformations in
\reftab{tab:SO2n6} and reflections no longer leave it
invariant. Then I do not see any problems with identifying
all copies of \EQV{2} with a single point. I just see greater
problems with a discontinuous $\pS/\SOn{2}$.

Regarding ignoring phase information. I think we both agree
that it is safer to integrate only in the original space. So
no matter how we construct the reduced space we do not need
to through away any information.


\item[Ruslan to Evangelos 2009-10-14]
I think you nailed it: The transformations that identify all
copies of \EQV{2} with a single point do not appear to
respect the reflection symmetry.  If that's the case then how
can you call it an 'antisymmetric subspace', if it's not
invariant under reflections?  I thought that this is how we
define the antisymmetric subspace in the first place (i.e.
that it's invariant under reflections).  Is it not so?


\item[Evangelos: 2009-10-16]
I call it antisymmetric only because points in the original
antisymmetric subspace are mapped to it. The correct term
would be the fixed point subspace of reflections
$\hat{\Refl}$ in the reduced space with coordinates $u_i$,
where now reflections $\hat{\Refl}$ are not defined in the
same way they are for the Fourier modes, but rather as in my
post of 2009-08-29. Perhaps it might help to have a look at
\reffig{fig:SO2inv}(a). There we can see that we still have
reflection symmetry. For instance the traveling waves come in
pairs. Points on the antisymmetric subspace are mapped on
points with $u_3=0$ in this projection. Of course this is a
projection on a modified set of invariants, but the idea is
the same.


\item[Ruslan: 2009-10-17]
OK, now I see where we differ.  I was hoping, maybe naively,
to find, for any $u(x) \in \pS$, a unique shift $\theta(u)$
such that $\tau_{\theta(u)} u(x) = u(x - \tilde{L}\theta(u))
\in \pS/\SOn{2}$.  I was also hoping that the shift could be
chosen such that $\theta(u) = 0$ (or $\pi$) for an
antisymmetric $u(x)$.  That's what I meant when I was saying
that my hope was that the antisymmetric subspace would belong
to $\pS/\SOn{2}$.

The phase of the 1st Fourier mode is doing the job quite
well, until we get to the point where $r_1 = \dot{r}_1 = 0$.
There I though I could use the 2nd Fourier mode, but
encountered the problem when looking at the unstable manifold
of \EQV{2}.  This manifold is antisymmetric, but it links two
points of \EQV{2} shifted by $\pi/2$ with respect to one
another.  So, I cannot construct $\theta(u)$ such that
$\theta(u) = 0$ (or $\pi$) in the antisymmetric subspace and
which identifies all \EQV{2} with a single point in
$\pS/\SOn{2}$.  And that's my dilemma...

\item[2009-10-28 Evangelos to renormalization experts]

One of my border ideas: Repeat the process that led to the
invariants of \reftab{tab:SO2n6a} in each irreducible subspace
$i$, \ie, apply the moving frame method by setting $c_i=0$ for
each $i$, producing invariants $u_k^i$ where $k$ labels
coordinates. Then $\sum_k u_k$ will be a set of linearly
independent invariants. We would be able to map all equilibria
to unique points in this basis if it where not for the
singularities at $b_i=c_i=0$ for every $i$. So we will need to
follow a regularization procedure to remove it, but it might
now be done in a more natural way than simply manipulating the
denominator. It just reminds me of procedures in which each
term in a sum diverges but the sum can be regularized. Fels and
Olver\rf{FelsOlver99} use regularization techniques for group
actions but it is too technical for me.

The practical problem is that I do not get the simplifications
that led to simple expressions in \reftab{tab:SO2n6a} when I try
to apply the moving frames method with $i>1$, I have no idea
why. So in thesis I add in appropriate places the invariants we
know that we will always get, \ie\ the Fourier magnitude in
each subspace.

\item[2009-12-12 Predrag]
There is extensive literature on reduction of symplectic manifolds with
symmetry.
Marsden and Weinstein 1974 article\rf{MaWe74}
might be a very early reference for such reduction.

Kirwan\rf{Kirwan88} ``The topology of reduced phase spaces of
the motion of vortices on a sphere.''

 Rink\rf{Rink200331}
``Symmetric invariant manifolds in
  the  {Fermi-Pasta-Ulam} lattice''. He says ``
The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) lattice with periodic boundary
conditions and n particles admits a large group of discrete
symmetries. The fixed point sets of these symmetries naturally
form invariant symplectic manifolds that are investigated in
this short note. For each k dividing n we find k degree of
freedom invariant manifolds. They represent short wavelength
solutions composed of k Fourier modes and can be interpreted as
embedded lattices with periodic boundary conditions and only k
particles. Inside these invariant manifolds other invariant
structures and exact solutions are found which represent for
instance periodic and quasi-periodic solutions and standing and
traveling waves. Similar invariant manifolds exist also in the
Klein-Gordon (KG) lattice and in the thermodynamic and
continuum limits.
''

\item[2010-01-05 Ruslan] I'm
going to spend more time on the KS problem.

Although, the prospects of making sense of its dynamics, even
for L = 22, appear to me rather dim.

Looking at the Lyapunov vectors, it is clear that there are 8
nontrivial dimensions in the KS with L = 22.  Even if we
manage to remove the symmetry and construct a good Poincar\'e
map, it will be at least a 6 dimensional map.

We barely know how to deal with the 2-dim map such as H\'enon,
and, once the map becomes a bit thicker, yet still 2-dim,
(e.g. Ikeda or Duffing), as far as I know, there is no good
way to map it to the symbolic dynamics (the best thing I know
in this direction is the construction of the generating
partition by Christiansen and Politi for the standard map).
So, what are we going to do with a 6-dim map?

In any case, I'm still not convinced that slices of any form
will help us, since they are constructed based on the local
behavior at some point, while the shifts in RPOs have global
nature.  So, while any particular slice might work for some
RPOs, it is very likely to fail for others (as observed by
Evangelos).

I'm going to run with the 1st Fourier mode for now, and will
try to construct an un-ambiguous Poincar\'e map with all the
RPOs and PPOs represented uniquely by points in the reduced
(hopefully 6-dim) space. But how we are going to visualize
this space, let alone make sense of the dynamics, I have no
clue.

\begin{description}

\item[2009-12-30 Evangelos, moving frame of $\REQV{-}{1}$.]
In \reffig{ks22sliceCond} I show that the number of
solutions of the $U(\gSpace) = 0$ slice fixing condition \beq
U(\gSpace) = \ssp^T \LieElrep(\gSpace)^T \Lg \,
\ssp_{\REQV{-}{1}} \ee{slicFixTW1} is greater than two (that
we had in \cLe) due to large higher harmonics in
$\ssp_{\REQV{-}{1}}$.

For this rpo (and all I have looked at) we have few ($4$ or
$6$) solutions corresponding to the fact that high $m$ modes
fall off rapidly. It appears that there is failure to get $6$
solutions when the magnitude of any of the first $6$ modes
becomes small. I cannot find in dasbuch/continuous.tex
Predrag's explanation of connection with Casimirs but I think
what he is after is uniqueness of solutions. Still, as the
traveling wave is not in any \fixedsp\ of a non-trivial
subgroup it does not posses any vanishing Fourier mode.

\item[2010-01-05 Predrag] I'll update ChaosBook.org soon -
Casimirs are perhaps still in the dasbuch repository only. I
did not think of their role in terms of multiple solutions to
\refeq{slicFixTW1} --good observation-- but it is the same
epicycles idea. As you can see in \refeq{Period1}, the
\SOn{2}\ $C_2^{(m)} = m^2$ Casimir shows up in the
denominator, so if the $m$th component of the slice-fixing
point \slicep\ is larger than $1/m$ (at least for Ruslan's
linear, non-coupled epicycles model), it causes the
retrograde motion and the related troubles for the
reconstruction equation. So each consecutive epicycle
magnitude has to be sufficiently small (certainly less than
$1/m$) so that no $m>1$ dominates the group velocity. As
Ruslan has shown (and I have rechecked), if $|\ssp_2|$
magnitude is larger than $|\ssp_2| \geq 1/2$ (\ie, $C_2^{(2)}\,
\ssp_2^* \ssp_2 \geq 1)$, the group velocity of the slice
point doubles, and a \rpo\ does not close in one period, but
only after two periods.

By such criterion $\ssp_{\REQV{-}{1}}$ of
\reffig{ks22sliceCond} is probably not a good choice of
slice-fixing point. You can engineer from it something better by
decreasing manually magnitude of $m=2,3,\cdots$ components.

\item[2010-01-05 Evangelos] There is something I do not
understand: Where the method of slices fails depends on the
choice of slice AND the trajectory. So for a \rpo\ we need to
have a condition on magnitude of $m=2,3,\cdots$ components of
each point on the \rpo\ rather than of the slice fixing
point, right? Ruslan in his example uses the initial point as
the slice fixing point so the two seem to coincide but in
general it won't be the case.

\item[2010-01-04 Evangelos]
The good news is that using a traveling wave to
fix a slice was sufficient to reduce about 40\%\ of the short orbits I've
tested to closed loops. For the rest we need a different slice.

\item[2010-01-05 Predrag] Do not understand. Are you saying that the
60\%\ of the short orbits you have tried do not close after one relative period,
or that they encounter the $ \dot{\gSpace} \to \pm\infty$ jumps?

\item[2010-01-05 Evangelos] Sorry, I was not clear on this. 60\%\ of the short orbits
I have tried do not close after one relative period. Since I just use the finite
transformations version (the ``moving frame method'') I do not need to worry about
$ \dot{\gSpace} \to \pm\infty$ jumps. There is some stretching of some orbits even the
ones that are closed loops after reduction, but it is not a great concern.

I wonder whether method of slices (integration on the slice) and moving
frame method (post-processing approach followed here) fail at the same
points. In theory the latter should only fail at points left invariant
under a continuous subgroup, for KS only at the origin. In practice where
a moving frame fails also depends on the choice of slice as we have seen
in \cLe.

\item[2010-01-05 Predrag] If the dot product of slice tangent
and orbit tangent are dominated by 3rd Fourier mode, \rpo\
will close only after 3rd repeat, so run them for several
periods.

\Mslices\ and \mframes\ `fail' at the same point, where the
denominator in the reconstruction equation goes through zero.
They do not fail, they just have a $\pi$ jump there.

Why do you guys keep saying that the \mslices\ fails for the
\Fix{\Group}\ flow-invariant subspace? The subspace is within
the slice. $\dot{\gSpace}=0$, the slice velocity equals the
full space velocity, so there is no problem, methinks.

\item[2013-07-07 Predrag] Sorry guys, Divakar says I have to do it:
    svn is so 20th century now we must git it, so I'm taking a part of
    siminos repository, converting this
    \texttt{svn} repository to \texttt{git}, pruning most of it, and
starting a new theory graduate student Burak (Nazmi B. Budanur
<budanur3@gatech.edu>) on it. One can continue working on the svn
repository using
    \HREF{http://mojodna.net/2009/02/24/my-work-git-workflow.html}
    {this web page}, but here my ambition is
    \HREF{http://thomasrast.ch/git/git-svn-conversion.html} {only one
    way},
    \HREF{http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git}
    {to create} a git repository, and work from then onward only within
    \texttt{git}. Did this in linux rather than windows, seems easier.

The author map \texttt{users.txt} is a text file
\begin{verbatim}
 svn log svn://zero.physics.gatech.edu/siminos |
 sed -ne 's/^r[^|]*|
 \([^ ]*\) |.*$/\1 = \1 <\1@zero.physics.gatech.edu>/p' |
 sort -u > users.txt
\end{verbatim}
that maps SVN usernames
to real names and email addresses for the git
history, with lines of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
svnuser = R. E. Alname <real@email.example.com>
\end{verbatim}
The result is pretty useless so it easier to create it by copying from svn@zero
editing:
\begin{verbatim}
repos/siminos/hooks/emaildict
\end{verbatim}
The project \texttt{reducesymm} is branchless (consists only of a single line of history), so:
\begin{verbatim}
git svn clone -A users.txt --no-metadata \
svn://zero.physics.gatech.edu/siminos reducesymm
\end{verbatim}
add your new Git server as a remote and push to it.
Here is an example of adding github.com server as a remote:
\begin{verbatim}
git remote add origin \
https://cvitanov:'det(1-zL)'@github.com/cvitanov/reducesymm.git
\end{verbatim}
To have all branches and tags go up, first update local rep (pull),
then push to the server
\begin{verbatim}
git pull origin --all
git push origin --all
git push origin --tags
\end{verbatim}
All branches and tags are now on the Git server in a nice,
clean import.

\item[2013-09-02 Evangelos] I've tried git before and I do not see many benefits compared
to svn. I like the decentralized model, but I prefer simpler version control systems than git,
something like bazaar.

Anyway, I am now a bit stuck... What credential should I use in order to access the repo?

% I've tried to clone the repository locally:
%
% git clone https://github.com/cvitanov/reducesymm.git
%
% I get the following error message:\\
