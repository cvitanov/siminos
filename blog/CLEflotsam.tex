We say that $\Group$ acts locally freely on \pS\ if for any
$\ssp\in\pS$ the isotropy subgroup $\stab{\ssp}$ is a
discrete subgroups of $\Group$. An r-dimensional compact Lie
group $\Group$ acts \emph{locally freely} on $\pS$ if and
only if it has $r-dimensional$ orbits\rf{FelsOlver99}. A
group $\Group$ acts freely on $\pS$ if all isotropy subgroups
are trivial: \stab{\ssp}=\{e\} for all $\ssp\in \Manif$. If
in addition for each point $\ssp\in \Manif$ there exists an
arbitrarily small neighborhood $U$ such that each orbit of
$\Group$ intersects $U$ in a pathwise connected subset, then
the group acts regularly.

A group $\Group$ acts semi-regularly on $\pS$ if all its

a group that acts semi-regularly foliate $\pS$. A sufficient
condition for a semi-regular action is that for any
$\ssp\in\pS$ the isotropy subgroup $\stab{\ssp}$ is a
discrete subgroup of $\Group$. If a Lie group $\Group$ acts
semi-regularly on a manifold $\Manif$,

Note that locally free action implies semi-regular action.
''

{\bf ES 2010-01-22 dropped:}
``
In this section we present the {\mframes}, introduced by G. Darboux and
systematized by \'E. Cartan\rf{CartanMF}.
Fels and Olver\rf{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99} reformulated the method so that a
moving frame is simply an equivariant mapping from the space on which a
group acts to the group parameter.

A moving frame is a smooth
$\Group$-equivariant mapping $\rho$ from $\Manif$ to the
$\Group$, that is to the group parameters.

One distinguishes between left moving frames for which
the equivariance condition is $\rho(\LieEl x)=\LieEl\rho(x)\,,\
x\in\Manif\,,\ \LieEl\in\Group$ and right moving frames for
which the equivariance condition is $\rho(\LieEl
x)=\rho(x)\LieEl^{-1}\,,\ x\in\Manif\,,\ \LieEl\in\Group$.  As shown in \refref{FelsOlver99} a moving frame exists
in a neighborhood of a point $x\in\Manif$ if and only if
$\Group$ acts freely and regularly near x.

For the practical
construction of a moving frame for an $N-$dimensional Lie group
$\Group$ we will need to define a slice.
Therefore the existence of a moving frame depends on
group orbits having the same dimension.

re-insert?: To construct a moving frame, let $K\subset\Manif$ be a {\slice}. For $x\in \Manif$, let
$\LieEl=\rho(x)$ be the unique group element that maps $x$
to the {\slice}: $g x = \rho(x) x\, \in K$. Then
$\rho:\Manif\rightarrow \Group$ is a right moving frame\rf{FelsOlver98}.

A {\slice} $K$ can be defined by means of level sets of
functions $K_i(x)=c_i$, where $x\in V$ and $i=1,\ldots,r$. If
the $K_i(x)$ coincide with the local coordinates $x_i$ on the
manifold $V$, \ie~$K_i(x)=x_i$,
..

{\bf ES:}
Moved example from movingFrames.tex here, some bits should still be rescued.

In this section we illustrate symmetry reduction through
the use of invariants computed
with the moving frame method in the example of \cLe.
The $z$-axis is the \fixedsp\ of \SOn{2} acting by
\refeq{eq:SO2act} on \Rls{5}. Therefore we can define
a coordinate {\slice} on $\Rls{5}\backslash\{x_1=x_2=y_1=y_2=0\}$
by, for instance,
\beq%\label{eq:CLEsliceSO2}
x_1=0,\,x_2>0\,.
\eeq
We can now construct a moving frame for the action
\refeq{eq:SO2act} of $\SOn{2}$ as follows. We write out
explicitly the group transformations:
\begin{subequations}%\label{eq:CLEnorm}
\begin{align}
 	\overline{x}_1 &= x_1 \cos\theta - x_2 \sin\theta\cont
	\overline{x}_2 &= x_1 \sin\theta + x_2 \cos\theta\cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= y_1 \cos\theta - y_2 \sin\theta\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &= y_1 \sin\theta + y_2 \cos\theta\cont	
	\overline{z} &= z\,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
We set $\overline{x}_1=0$ and solve
\refeq{eq:CLEexplSO2a} for the group parameter to obtain the moving frame
\beq
	\theta=\tan^{-1}\frac{x_1}{x_2}
% 	\label{eq:CLEmf}
\eeq
which brings any point  back to the {\slice}.
Here it is important that
$\tan^{-1}$ distinguishes quadrants in the $(x_1,x_2)$ plane to ensure that the
transformation results in the correct geometric
interpretation, \ie\ to ensure $x_2>0$.
Substituting \refeq{eq:CLEmf} in the remaining equations \refeq{eq:CLEnorm} we
get the invariants
\beq
\begin{split}
	\overline{x}_2 &=  r_1 = \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2} \cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= {(x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2)}/{r_1}\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &= {(x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2)}/{r_1}\cont	
	\overline{z} &= z\,.
% 	\label{eq:invLaser}
\end{split}
\eeq
{\bf ES:} The solution $\theta = 2
    \tan^{-1}\frac{-x_2+\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}{x_1}$ was
    returned by Mathematica. If we use $\theta =
    \tan^{-1}\frac{x_2}{x_1}$ without taking care of the
    quadrant our results are multiplied by $sgn(x_2)$.


{\bf ES: I will need to rewrite the following}

In terms of projecting dynamics
on variables \refeq{eq:invLaser} (or applying the equivalent
procedure of rotating points back to the \slice) this means that
we need to take into account the direction along which
we approach zero and use the `angle
of descent' as the angle with which we rotate points back to the \slice, if such
points have exactly $x=0$.

Note that the invariants are not defined on
the subspace $U_S$ defined by $x_1=x_2=0$ even though the
group action is non-regular only in a subset of $U_S$, the
$z$-axis $x_1=x_2=y_1=y_2=0$ which is the \fixedsp\ of \SOn{2}.
In the spirit of \refref{GL-Gil07b} the transformations \refeq{eq:invLaser}
can therefore be characterized as non-optimal, in the sense
that we have singularity in a proper superset of $\Fix{\SOn{2}}$.
    \PC{``proper superset''? Il cano no parla questa lingua}
The reason the transformations fail on $U_S$ and not only on the $z$-axis
can be traced back to the way we construct the moving frame. The action
of the group can be thought of as a direct sum of irreducible
actions and the corresponding invariant (linearly irreducible)
subspaces are the $(x_1,\,x_2)$ and $(y_1,\,y_2)$
planes.
%PC OK \ES{Not sure if planes is acceptable term here.}.
Since irreducible subspaces are by definition group-invariant
implies that we could define a moving frame in any one of
them independently. The singular subspace would then be
determined by the fixed points of group action in this
subspace alone. For instance, by choosing an angle in the
$(x_1,\,x_2)$ irreducible subspace as the moving frame map,
the singular set is the point $x_1=x_2=0$ in this irreducible
subspace. Going back to the full $5$-dimensional space the
singular set of the transformations is still given by
$x_1=x_2=0$.
%}

{\bf ES:} I follow Gilmore, he uses the term for
singularities arising in Hilbert basis transformation
problems.

It would appear
that such a singularity in the moving frame transformation
does not affect us, since \ssp\ that satisfy
\refeq{cLeMFsing} are already on the \slice.

While a singularity in $\Fix{\SOn{2}}$ cannot be reached by
generic orbits as {\fixedsp s} are flow invariant, the same
is not true for {\fixedsp s} of irreducible representations
of the group action\ES{make sure!!!}. The fact that
trajectories of \cLf\ in \reffig{fig:CLEmf} stay away from
$r_1=0$ is therefore fortuitous.


{\bf PC 2010-01-26} dropped:

Another theorist's temptation is to hope that a continuous
symmetry would lead us to a conserved quantity. However,
Noether theorem requires that equations of motion be cast in
Lagrangian form and that the Lagrangian exhibits variational
symmetries\rf{Bluman07,BlumanAnco02}. Such variational
symmetries are hard to find for dissipative systems.

As the systems that we study here are not associated with a
variational principle, Noether's theorem does not
apply, and in general no conserved
quantities are associated with continuous symmetries of
such systems.
    \PC{include discussion, references from the blog here.}


Rotation of $\ssp$ by angle $\theta$
to the slice defined by \refeq{PCsectQ1} is a linear operation
for any given point and can be applied efficiently
even in a high dimensional space. This is especially true
for truncations of PDEs, when typically the rotation group
representation is a direct sum of irreducible
representations and one is not force to store large matrices.
Of course, the transformation is still non-linear
through the dependence on the angle and equivalent to the
explicit transformations \refeq{eq:invLaser}.

{\bf PC 2010-01-26:}
   The problem with giving Krupa the credit is that he is
   generalizing bifurcation from a fixed point to a Hopf
   cycle, ie., he has a 'quasi-periodic modulated traveling' wave in mind.
   Our \rpo's arise from stretching and folding, nor from a
   bifurcation.

%           \refeq{EqMotionMovFramePC} is correct
%           there are problems with the derivation.

{\bf ES 2010-01-27 merged with existing intro:}
                                                        \toCB
The notion of a {\em moving frame} as a map from a manifold
to a Lie group was introduced by Cartan\rf{CartanMF}. Fels
and Olver view the method as an alternative to the Gr\"obner
bases methods for computing Hilbert polynomials, to compute
functionally independent fundamental invariant bases for
general group actions (with no explicit connection to
dynamics, differential equations or symmetry reduction).
`Fundamental' here means that they can be used to generate
all other invariants. Olver's monograph\rf{OlverInv} is
pedagogical, but does not describe the original Cartan's
method. Fels and Olver papers\rf{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99} are
lengthy and technical. They refer to Cartan's method as
method of `moving frames' and view it as a special and less
rigorous case of their `moving coframe' method. The name
`moving coframes' arises through the use of Maurer-Cartan
form which is a coframe on the Lie group $\Group$, \ie, they
form a pointwise basis for the cotangent space.


{\bf ES 2010-01-07:} No! You either rotate a point on the trajectory, or the coordinate
	frame as a whole, you never mix the active and passive view of the transformations.
	I suspect what you mean is that you can fix the slice by different points along
	a group orbit as slice fixing points and at the end rotate all \emph{desymmetrized} trajectories
	to a common slice. But this is not what the text says and it is anyway a complication
	that is not essential. You can rotate all initial points to the slice, then integrate.

    {\bf PC 2010-01-28}: Emphasize; the most general form of a linear slice condition for
    \cLe. The point of my rescaling was to show that one needs only 2 numbers,
    not three ($\slicepComp{x}{1},\,\slicepComp{y}{1},\,\slicepComp{y}{2}$)
    to fix the slice. Was I wrong?
    \\
    {\bf ES}: It's a matter of taste. If you rescale
    you need to provide as with the scale factor, so you need once again three numbers.
    It's a linear slice so even when deriving something I don't mind multiplying with
    a constant rather than with $1$. So I prefer to use what I also use in numerics,
    three numbers.
    \\
    {\bf PC}: look at \refeq{cLeMFsing}. Slice fixing point
    appears linearly in both the numerator and denominator,
    so you are free to rescale it as you wish, ie. there is
    no need for 3 numbers. This will be true also for situations where
    you have many Fourier modes. The point is that the slice
    hyperplane includes the origin, so slice point only
    provides its direction, the distance to the origin is
    irrelevant.
      \\
    {\bf PC}: make `coordinate slice' (stupid name) a `linear slice' or `hyperplane slice'
    everywhere.  I agree about the name being stupid but coordinate slices are special
    among linear slices because they only involve ONE coordinate.


{\bf ES 2010-01-28:}
We observe that dynamics cannot enter $\Fix{\SOn{2}}$, \ie\
the $z$-axis, since {\fixedsp s} are flow invariant. Since
\SOn{2} representation in the \cLe\ example is a direct sum
of irreducible representations we cannot take more than one
irreducible subspace into account when setting up the
slice conditions, at least not in a convenient way. We
can however restore democracy between modes and extend
validity of the transformations to any point where the group
acts freely, by modifying the invariants as follows:
\beq
\begin{split}
	\overline{x}_2 &= (x_1^2+x_2^2)/r \cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= -(x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2)/r\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &=(x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2)/r\cont
	\overline{z} &=z\cont
	r &= \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+y_1^2+y_2^2}
    \,.
	\label{eq:invLaser2}
\end{split}
\eeq
This set of invariants lacks a geometric interpretation
    \ES{or does it?}
but results in much cleaner phase portraits, \cf\
\reffig{fig:CLEinv}.

information. {\bf ES} Do you think that generic trajectories do enter $x_1=x_2=0$
or that it is not a fortuitous event?

{\bf ES dropped text from stability appendix:}

Using the {\mframes} to map dynamics on a slice $\pSRed$ as
in refsect~{sec:mf} or restricting integration on the slice
as in refsect~{sec:MovFrameODE}, the reduced \statesp\ is
identified (at least locally) with the {\slice} ${\pSRed}$.
This provides a means of calculating stability of \reqva\ in
reduced \statesp. Proof that such a notion of stability of
\reqva\ is meaningful is given, for instance, in
\refref{Krupa90}.  To simplify notation we only treat
the one-dimensional group case and drop all group parameter
related indices, writing $\Lg_{ij}$ instead of
$(\Lg_1)_{ij}$, \etc.

{\bf ES to Predrag:}
 I couldn't find Chossat and Lauterbach book
    here. If you have it would it be easy to have a look at their
    expression for stability of \reqva? Is this claim correct? I
    remember that my motivation to derive it was that their
    expression is too implicit to use in practice, while Krupa's
    is totally abstract. But maybe I was missing something.
    {\bf PC:} no time for me to go to the library now
    and check this...

defsCLE.tex  2010-01-26 contains this:
\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand\Poincare{Poincar\'e}
  % ES: It is {Poincar\'e } in ChaosBook, is this on purpose?
  % PC it's the same symbol, no?
  % ES: There is a trailing space in contrast to most macros.
  % No major issue, I'm just used to add an extra \ after macros
  % and with this it looks like too much white space.
\end{verbatim}
