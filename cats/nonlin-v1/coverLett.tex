Dear Editor,

This article, we feel, belongs to Nonlinearity, both for as
an application od dynamical system methods to physics field theory
and many-body quantum chaos problems, and as natural next step
to the earlier work published in Nonlinearity, in particular to

    B. Gutkin and V. Osipov,
    Classical foundations of many-particle quantum chaos,
    Nonlinearity 29, 325â€“356 (2016)

It is a classical field theory step on the way to formulating a theory of
quantum chaos in many-body systems and quantum field theory.
We believe that these techniques can also be useful in studies
of spatiotemporal chaos, in particular shear-flow turbulence.

Yours sincerely,
   Predrag Cvitanovic
