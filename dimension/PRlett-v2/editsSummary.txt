Summary of edits, revision of June 5, 2016
==========================================
The revised text is highlighted in red in DCTSCD14_highlight_edits.pdf,

- We have added one more covariant Lyapunov vectors reference,
  Wolfe and Samelson ref. [11] in paragraph 2:
  "Specifically, numerical investigations of the dynamics of
  covariant	Lyapunov vectors, made possible by the algorithms
  developed in refs. [10â€“12],"	

- We have merged and rearranged the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs on
  page 2 to clarify the definitions of pre-periodic orbits and
  relative periodic orbits , as suggested by referee B.

- We explicitly state the number of positive Floquet/Lyapunov
  exponents and their values in the caption of Fig.1 to resolve
  possible confusion, as requested by referee B.

- We have removed superscript $loc$ in the y-axis label
  in fig. 1(b), to make the labeling consistent with the text.
