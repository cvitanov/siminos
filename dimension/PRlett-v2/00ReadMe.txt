PUBLICITY AND OUTREACH:

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit a summary that clarifies
the new elements of the work and their expected impact. These summaries help
APS editors consider papers for coverage in the following venues:
        
- Physics (http://physics.aps.org): Daily online-only news and commentary about
  a selection of papers from the APS journal collection.

- Media tip sheets: News briefs distributed to credentialed journalists about
  forthcoming papers. 

- Editors' Suggestions: Papers that are judged to be particularly important,
  interesting, or well written are highlighted and prominently displayed on our
  journal websites. 

Summaries may also be distributed to other (non-APS) media outlets.

Guidelines for writing a publicity and outreach summary and how to submit it
can be found here:
http://journals.aps.org/authors/publicity-outreach-instructions-authors

COVERAGE BY YOUR NEWS OFFICE: 

Please inform your institution's public-information or news office as soon as
possible about this acceptance. This office may publish newsletters and reports
describing the institution's research or it may keep lists of papers published
in major journals.  In some cases the writers may want to publicize your work
with the local media, and they need as much lead time as possible.  To find the
appropriate office, try searching for your institution's name at
http://sciencesources.eurekalert.org or http://www.newswise.com/resources/ncd/.
