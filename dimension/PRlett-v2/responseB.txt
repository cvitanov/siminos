Report of Referee B -- LR15587/Ding
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are points I would like the authors to check again (and to
revise the manuscript accordingly):

(1) In the first column of page 2 the notions of “pre-periodic orbits”
and “relative periodic orbits” appear for the first time (in this
manuscript) and I think it would be useful for the reader if a short
definition or characterization of the two types of orbits would be
given here.

Response:
    (1) We have now reordered the text in a minor way (see
    color-coded edits in the referee version of the PDF file) so
    “pre-periodic orbits” and “relative periodic orbits” are now
    defined before being used in the text.

(2) I am a little bit confused with Fig.1a (and the corresponding
figure caption). In the diagram I see a positive Lyapunov exponent
(red square) for the relative periodic orbit and no positive exponent
for the chaotic trajectory (black crosses). Is this correct? If yes,
please comment in the caption or the main text. Furthermore, in the
caption it is written “The number of the vanishing exponents is always
two.” but if you look at the inset of Fig.1a you see 2 red square
close to zero, but 4 blue circles and 4 (or 3?) black crosses at zero.
How does this fit together?

Response:
    (2)In Fig.1a, blue circles and red squares are real parts of
    Floquet exponents of PPO10.25 and RPO16.31 respectively. Only
    the black crosses are for Lyapunov exponents. So yes, there is
    only one positive Floquet exponent (not Lyapunov exponent) for
    the relative periodic orbit with period 16.31, and one positive
    Lyapunov exponent (black crosses). It is true that it is hard
    to detect it since there are three different sets here. We will
    take your suggestion and make it clearer in the caption.

    For the number of vanishing exponents, only 2 blue circles are
    exactly zero, not 4. The real parts of the leading 5 exponents
    for ppo10.25 are
    0.0332, 0.0332 (a complex eigenvalue pair), 0, 0, -0.216.
    So the first two are slightly positive but not zero. Also, for
    the Lyapunov exponents (black crosses), the 4th exponent is
    -0.003 not zero, as indicated in the caption.

    We have now listed explicit values of all positive exponents,
    in hope that the caption now answers your questions.

Thank you for your suggestions.
We really appreciate your valuable time.
