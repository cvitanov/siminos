Estimating the finite dimension of an inertial manifold for a
spatio-temporally chaotic system from unstable periodic orbits (UPOs)
is a long-lasting challenge in the nonlinear dynamics community. The
authors study the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system at a moderate system
size such that the hierarchy of UPOs, derived in an earlier paper by
some of the authors. They show that the entangled (non-transient
modes) Floquet manifold of an UPO coincides locally with the physical
manifold determined from covariant Lyapunov vectors. This information
seems to be derivable from any of the chaotic orbits on the attractor.
The manuscript is well written. I can only recommend to publish this
manuscript in PRL as is, as it is of high relevance to readers of PRL.
