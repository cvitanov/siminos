----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this manuscript the authors present very detailed numerical studies 
showing that essential information about the inertial manifold of an 
extended system can be obtained from unstable periodic orbits embedded 
in the attracting set, or more specifically, that the entangled (or 
“physical’ tangent manifold) obtained from angle distributions of 
covariant (finite-time) Lyapunov vectors coincides with the splitting 
“entangled-transient” of the Floquet vectors (of the unstable periodic 
orbits). Demonstrated with simulations of a one-dimensional 
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation this a very important observation which 
substantially advances the field of high dimensional chaos in 
spatially extended systems is. In my opinion this manuscript fulfills 
all criteria for publication in PRL and therefore I recommend to 
accept it. 

There are, however, some points I would like the authors to check 
again (and to revise the manuscript accordingly): 

(1) In the first column of page 2 the notions of “pre-periodic orbits” 
and “relative periodic orbits” appear for the first time (in this 
manuscript) and I think it would be useful for the reader if a short 
definition or characterization of the two types of orbits would be 
given here. 

(2) I am a little bit confused with Fig.1a (and the corresponding 
figure caption). In the diagram I see a positive Lyapunov exponent 
(red square) for the relative periodic orbit and no positive exponent 
for the chaotic trajectory (black crosses). Is this correct? If yes, 
please comment in the caption or the main text. Furthermore, in the 
caption it is written “The number of the vanishing exponents is always 
two.” but if you look at the inset of Fig.1a you see 2 red square 
close to zero, but 4 blue circles and 4 (or 3?) black crosses at zero. 
How does this fit together?

Response to Referee B -- LR15587/Ding

Thanks for your support. We really appreciate your valuable time.

For point (1), We merge and rearrange the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs 
on page 2 to make the exposition to pre-periodic orbits and relative 
periodic orbits smoothly. Symmetries are introduced immediately 
after the basic numerical setup. Then we propose the definition
of pre-periodic orbits and relative periodic orbits, followed by
definition of Floquet exponents/vectors.

For point (2), in Fig.1a, blue circles and red squares are 
Floquet exponents of PPO10.25 and RPO16.31 respectively. Only the black 
crosses are for Lyapunov exponents. So yes, there is only one positive 
Floquet exponent (not Lyapunov exponent) for the relative periodic orbit
with period 16.31, and one positive Lyapunov exponent (black crosses). 
It is true that it is hard to detect it since there are three different 
sets here. We will take your suggestion and make it explicit in the caption.

For the number of vanishing exponents, only 2 blue circles are exactly 
zeros not 4. The leading 5 exponents for ppo10.25 are
0.0332, 0.0332, 0, 0, -0.216. So the first two are slightly positive 
but not zero. Also, for the Lyapunov exponents (black crosses), the 4th
exponent is -0.003 not zero as indicated in the caption. The number of
zero exponents is exactly two because there are two marginal directions
in the tangent space for any invariant orbit, more precisely, 
the velocity direction and SO(2) group tangent direction. The majority 
of pre-periodic and relative periodic orbits in our database are weekly
unstable with only one or two positive Floquet exponents. 
There is no contradiction between the figure and the text.

========
ES: Maybe for point (2) in addition to the clarification in the caption 
we could add a table containing some of the Floquet and 
Lyapunov exponents in Suppl. Material? This would be useful also for the
reader who would like to reproduce/verify the study.

HC: Excellent news!! we should detail a bit where are the changes made 
regarding point 1, and we should even reproduce the sentence(s) 
added in the text of the paper.

Regarding point 2, we could maybe give the values of the various 
exponents involved  in the caption of the figure.. 
should not take too much space...

Regarding gaining some space, we could modify a bit Figures 2 & 3:
I suggest  (almost) collating the 2 panels in Fig.2, 
effectively getting rid of the x-axis labels for the top panel, 
and also change the style of the x-axis labels left 
from "\frac{1}{n}\pi" to "\pi/n".
Similar modification could be done in Fig3 almost 
collating panels (c) and (e), and (d) and (f)...
