\@doendnote{endnote38}{ Refs.\protect \nobreakspace  {}\cite {YaTaGiChRa08,TaGiCh11,YaRa11} include the marginal Galilean symmetry mode in the mode count; here this mode is absent, as we have set $\DOTSI \intop \ilimits@ {}u(x,t)dx=0$. Consequently, the number of the {entangled} modes (the dimension of the physical manifold) differs by one. }
