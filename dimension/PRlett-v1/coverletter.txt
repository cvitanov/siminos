"Estimating dimension of inertial manifold from unstable periodic orbits"
X. Ding, H. Chat\'e, P. Cvitanovi\'c, E. Siminos, and K. A. Takeuchi


Dear Editor,

Dissipative partial differential equations with chaotic or
turbulent solutions are ubiquitous in many areas of science.
Although formally infinite-dimensional, it is believed, and in some
cases proved, that their dynamics lives on a finite-dimensional
manifold called the inertial manifold. As a matter of fact, the
very possibility of their numerical integration can be seen as
founded on the existence of such an inertial manifold.

Until now, there has been no constructive approach to the inertial
manifold, with mathematical results providing at best some
reasonable bounds on its dimensionality. This is unfortunate, since
such an approach would allow for meaningful reduced descriptions of
a wealth of complicated problems.

In the work we hereby submit to PRL, we provide the first steps
toward a constructive approach of the inertial manifold. In
particular, we show that unstable periodic orbits, which are
believed to constitute the backbone of chaotic/turbulent dynamics,
do carry information on the dimension of the inertial manifold. We
show how this dimension can be estimated from a large-enough set of
unstable orbits, and that the finite-dimensional, `entangled'
subspaces of their linearized neighborhoods provide an explicit
tiling of the inertial manifold. Our results also clarify the
connection to the previous related work based on computation of
`covariant Lyapunov vectors', and show that --as far as the
dimensionality of the inertial manifold is concerned-- the
determination of unstable periodic orbits (often a difficult task)
is not strictly required, since covariant Lyapunov vectors
description of the linear instabilities (in the so-called tangent
space) along chaotic/turbulent trajectories suffices to determine
this dimension.

Because of their generality, these results could have broad impact
in many subfields of physics and beyond. They can be seen as
opening up new avenues to deal with outstanding critical problems
in the study of turbulent flows. We thus believe PRL is the ideal
venue for their publication.

Sincerely,
X. Ding, H. Chate, P. Cvitanovic, E. Siminos, and K. A. Takeuchi

(50-words summary)

Dissipative partial differential equations with turbulent solutions
are ubiquitous in many areas of science. Although formally
infinite-dimensional, their dynamics live on a finite-dimensional
'inertial' manifold. We provide the first steps towards a
constructive approach of this object and determine its dimension
using only a set of unstable orbits.
