Dear Xiong Ding,

We have successfully generated output from the manuscript file sent to
our Editorial Office.  The manuscript is being processed and has been
assigned the accession code number cited above.  This code number
should be included in all future correspondence.

Once information concerning your manuscript has been put into our
database, the above code number may be used to obtain current
information regarding the status of your manuscript from the Author
Status Inquiry System (ASIS) at http://authors.aps.org/STATUS/  Note
that depending on workloads in the office and other factors, preliminary
processing may take one to several days, so that initially the
information available via ASIS may be very incomplete (e.g., only one
or two authors, incomplete title, no address or communications
information).  In this period, please do not be concerned and do NOT
send us requests to insert the missing information.

When resubmitting your manuscript in response to recommendations and
criticisms from the review process, or to present other corrections and
author revisions during the review process, the full file should be
resubmitted electronically, preferably via our web server at
http://authors.aps.org/Submissions/.  Resubmission procedures can be
found at
http://journals.aps.org/authors/web-submission-guidelines-physical-review.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Yours sincerely,

Answer email from APS about why word count tool does not work for our manuscript

Michele Hake (APS)

Dear Dr. Ding,

Thank you for writing. The word count tool and reference
check will not work when a second .tex file is being called
into the main .tex file.

Our staff will check the length after a manuscript code number
is assigned.

The reference check on the Submissions Server is an optional tool,
and it is not required for submission. Should your manuscript be
accepted for publication, you will need to verify the accuracy of
your references, along with our production vendor.

I hope this is helpful.

Sincerely,

Michele Hake

For some unknown reason, the word count tool and reference check
tool failed to work for the manuscript.
