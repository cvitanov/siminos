\item[2015-9-20 Xiong] I am not convinced by the previous
statements that the dimension of inertial manifold for
\KSe\ at $L=22$ is exactly 8. I think this is only a lower bound.
I have a simple reasoning. The Kaplan-Yorke dimension\rf{KapYor79, FaOttYo83}
\beq
    D_{KY}= k + \frac{1}{|\Lyap^{(k+1)}|} \sum_{i=1}^k \Lyap^{(i)}
\,,
\ee{KapYorDim}
where $k$ is the largest integer such that the Lyapunov exponents sum
$\sum_{i=1}^k \Lyap^{(i)}>0$,
is formulated as the lower bound of the dimension of strange attractor. 
For hyperbolic systems,  $D_{KY}$  could be larger than the number of
expanding \cLvs, so the dimension 
of inertial manifold should be larger than the number of 
expanding \cLvs, At the same time, since the angle 
between expanding bundle and contracting bundle is bounded away from
zero, then our method will say that the dimension of the inertial 
manifold is just the number of expanding directions. These two 
statements are contradicting.
