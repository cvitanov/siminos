Dear Xiong & Hugues,
I have to say I find your paper really interesting. The ideas put forward are really nice, and
your results are surely something to think about carefully (indeed I had to digest your paper a little bit and re-read it at least once).

For instance, I was initially surprised by the fact that ALL po have the same number of physical modes, but this could be natural if you think that they have to be contained in the inertial manifold, and that it is not unlikely to think that po living in a lower dimesnional subset should be quite unlikely (something like zero-measure?). You say something about this in the conclusions, but maybe you could comment more explicitly on this point.

Also, it seems to me that your results imply (or assume?) continuity over the attractor of the covariant vectors (or better put of the Oseledets splitting structure). This is always a delicate point maybe worth discussing. I know that Gary Froyland form UNSW Australia is working on this and he could be really interested in your results. There are a few  (mostly mathematical) papers where these continuity issues are discussed, but I am not sure the hypothesis they put forward are meaningful for dissipative systems:

The Ershov and Potapov one in Physica D 118, 167 (1998)
and these two references given to me by Gary Froyland:

http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~froyland/semi-inv-holder-cty_16final.pdf

Apart from this, I have a few questions/comments (maybe more later):

1.
When in Fig. 3 you test the separation vector between the chaotic and the periodic orbit (BTW, I think there is a typo two lines after Eq. (6), it should be w_n and not w_k ), Fig. 3c and 3e nicely confirm the
bounding of the angle by the separation norm for n>=7.
However, I wonder why in Figs. 3d and 3f the average angles for n>=17 show clear deviations
from a linear behavior at small separation values. Is it just an accuracy issue?


2.
If I understand well your local Floquet exponents, it is really an instantaneous object.
Your results in Fig. 1b-c clearly show that something drastically different is going on between
exponents 1-8 and the rest. This is perfectly convincing to me.
However, the fact that you are using the \tau -> 0 limit puts you out of the domain of the
Bochi and Viana dominated splitting results, and maybe you should be more clear about this.

I wonder if one could get a little bit more rigorous (and close to the dominated splitting result by B&V) by considering -- like you are doing with angles in Fig. 2 -- ensembles of pos.
What I mean is: if, for each orbit p of period T_p, you compute the smallest time tau_m such that the first 8 finite time exponents \lambda_i^tau_m are dominated, and then you consider the distribution of these tau_m/T_p values over all periodic orbits, what are you going to see?
Could it be that this distribution is NOT clearly  bounded away from 1? These I think would reconcile your results with B&V.
But this is just a curiosity, I am not at all implying you should also add this to your already impressive paper.

3.
One curiosity: In the caption of Fig. 1 you specify that the 4th LE is small but strictly negative,
so that you would only have 1 positive exponent (and 2 zero ones).
This is clearly the case for the rpo 16.31 while your ppo 10.25 numerics seem to give a positive second LE with a zero 3rd and 4th ones. The fact that for this orbit the first 2 LEs are nonzero (and practically identically) is also confirmed by Fig. 2c, where their instantaneous Floquet exps looks really the same!
Is this just a problem of numerical accuracy or do you think there is some dimensional variability at play?
Did you had a look at some other periodic orbit for this?

4.
If I understand correctly what you are doing, I think Eq. (5) could be slightly clearer if you write the po term as u_p(x + t_p) where 0<=t_p<T_p is some phase shift along the orbit to minimize the in-slice distance.

Anyhow, it is really a nice work, congratulations...

Cheers

Francesco

Dear Xiong Ding,

thank you for the reference. The topic is interesting and it looks like
your have obtained promising results. I will read your paper and write
you again later.


Best regards,
Pavel Kupstsov.


P.S. Your mail server do not trust to my mail provider, so I send it
with a bit delay from another address.

Dear Xiong,

  Thank you for the paper.
  As a  matter of fact, I had found it a day before your e-mail.
  I thought how to connect your approach with our
  analysis of dimension, but up to now without progress :(

  WBR

Dear Xiong Ding,

Many thanks for sending your interesting manuscript. I am sorry for
the slow reply. You might be interested to know that, along with
your reference 10, there was an alternate method of obtaining the
characteristic Lyapunov vectors proposed independently and nearly
simultaneously:
Wolfe, C. L., and R. M. Samelson, 2007. An efficient method for
recovering Lyapunov vectors from singular vectors. Tellus, 59A,
355-366.

The two methods have been compared by
Kuptsov and Parlitz, J Nonlinear Sci, 2011.

Best regards,
Roger
