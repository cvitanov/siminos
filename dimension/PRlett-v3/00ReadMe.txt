ES, PC responses to the proofs queries
[internal comments are given in brackets]:

Q1: we agree with the change to the title
Q2: Postal code is: SE-412 96
Q3: Please change the last sentence of acknowledgment to make it preciser.

    Currently it reads:
    K.A.T. acknowledges support by KAKENHI (No. 25707033 from JSPS and No.
    25103004 `Fluctuation \& Structure' from MEXT in Japan) and the JSPS
    Core-to-Core Program `Non-equilibrium dynamics of soft matter and
    information'.

    Please change it to:
    K.A.T. acknowledges support by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP25707033 and 
    JP25103004, as well as the JSPS Core-to-Core Program `Non-equilibrium 
    dynamics of soft matter and information'.


Q4: "G. Robinson, Jr." is not a dedication but an acknowledgement
    of funding. Now rephrased:

    X.D. and P.C. were supported by a grant from G. Robinson, Jr.,
    and by the National Science Foundation under Grants
    No. DMS-1211827 and CMMI-1028133.

Q5: Ref. [13]
    We have not found a DOI for Ref. [13], but it is available
    online with URL http://mi.mathnet.ru/eng/mmo214 , or in
    Tran Moscow Math Soc, Vol 19 (1968), American Mathematical Soc.,
    ISBN	0821895230, 9780821895238. It is a famous paper with
    at least 3000 citations, including APS publications such as
    http://journals.aps.org/pre/references/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.062208.
    Perhaps your database has reference to the original in Russian,
    but we prefer citing the version in English.

    Ref. [20] page number should be 356. The DOI is 10.1143/PTP.55.356

Line 29, 79, 85, 126, 127, 132, 133, 141, 208, 230, 231, 232:
        orbit s -> orbits
        [I think that this is caused by using macros: \po s is OK in Latex
        but conversion to XML does not handle it correctly]
Line 132, 133, F1:1, F1:4, F1:9, 152, 266, 274:
        The bar should span ppo and rpo
        (please check original Latex-generated pdf)
Line 235, 236, 286 : hat should be centered above J
Line 236: hat should be centered above e
Line 307: transient s -> transient

have been taken into account.
