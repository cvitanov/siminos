Q1: We agree with the change to the title

Q2: Postal code is: SE-412 96

Q3: Please change the last sentence of acknowledgment to make it preciser.

    Currently it reads:
    K.A.T. acknowledges support by KAKENHI (No. 25707033 from JSPS and No.
    25103004 `Fluctuation \& Structure' from MEXT in Japan) and the JSPS
    Core-to-Core Program `Non-equilibrium dynamics of soft matter and
    information'.

    Please change it to:
    K.A.T. acknowledges support by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP25707033 and 
    JP25103004, as well as the JSPS Core-to-Core Program `Non-equilibrium 
    dynamics of soft matter and information'.


Q4: "G. Robinson, Jr." is not a dedication but an acknowledgement
    of funding. Now rephrased:

    X.D. and P.C. were supported by a grant from G. Robinson, Jr.,
    and by the National Science Foundation under Grants
    No. DMS-1211827 and CMMI-1028133.
