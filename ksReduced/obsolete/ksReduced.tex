\section{Introduction\label{s:intro}}

% Recent developments in the study of fluids and other dissipative,
% spatially-extended systems suggest that certain types of intrinsically
% low-dimensional behavior can be understood by means of the theory of
% dynamical systems. In particular, studies of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
% partial differential equation (PDE) and of the plane Couette flow indicate that
% the low-dimensional manifolds of unstable equilibria play the key role in
% organizing the high-dimensional state-space, in a way familiar from the study
% of low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
% An important limitation of studies that embrace this point of view is that,
% so far, the significance of traveling wave solutions as organizing centers
% has not been clarified, even though these constitute the most commonly
% encountered stationary solutions in fluid flows.
%
% Wave motion appears as a result of the translational symmetry of the partial
% differential equations that describe continuous media, which in turn can be
% traced back to the basic assumptions on the nature of space and the physical
% laws. Waves which maintain a constant shape during their propagation,
% also termed relative equilibria, are translationally invariant solutions and can
% be thought of as equilibria in a co-moving frame. However, we are interested here
% in a global state-space picture and, as multiple traveling waves of different
% speeds commonly exist for any given flow parameter, the use of a single
% co-moving frame is rendered problematic for our purposes. Moreover, solutions
% with broken symmetry also do exist, for instance modulated traveling waves in
% which the wave profile is characterized by a periodic modulation (whence the
% alternative name relative periodic orbit). Furthermore, the generic,
% turbulent solutions are characterized by drifts along the direction of wave
% propagation.
%
% To illustrate how this obscures the understanding of global
% state-space geometry, we present in \reffig{f:ksIntro}(a) a state-space
% portrait of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) flow
% (introduced in \refsect{s:notions}), in a periodic spatial domain of length
% $L=22$. We think of the KS flow in terms of its $\Nd$-dimensional Fourier
% space truncation, with $\Nd$ large enough for well-resolved simulations.
% The projection in \reffig{f:ksIntro}(a) is onto the the real parts of
% the three leading Fourier modes and suffers from the tendency of solutions to drift
% around (in Fourier space, translations become rotations).
%
% The main achievement of this paper is to show how the mess
% of \reffig{f:ksIntro}(a) can be brought
% to the comprehensible and useful representation of \reffig{f:ksIntro}(b) in
% which the role of unstable manifolds of traveling waves in organizing the global
% geometry becomes apparent. The means by which the transition from
% \reffig{f:ksIntro}(a) to \reffig{f:ksIntro}(a) is achieved is \emph{symmetry
% reduction}: the variables onto which we project in \reffig{f:ksIntro}(b) are
% translationally invariant (or rotationally invariant if we think in terms of
% Fourier modes) and span the $\Nd-1$-dimensional \emph{reduced space} in which
% wave motion appears frozen.
%

The relation of such singularities to the choice of a slice has been
discussed in \refrefs{SiminosThesis,SiCvi10,FrCv11,BudCvi14}. In
\refrefs{rowley_reconstruction_2000,SiCvi10,FrCv11} the use of multiple
local hyperplane slices to cover state space has been proposed. However,
the task of picking such a set of slices and piecing them together in a
manner that does not obscure the global picture appears highly non-trivial,
and we know of no successful implementation of such state-space tessellation
proposals. Here we will take a different path and introduce modifications
of equations \refeq{eq:O2cheb} which yield \emph{globally} well behaved
transformations to invariant variables.

Following \refref{SCD07}, all computations in this paper are carried out
for $L = 22$ system. For this system size Davidchack (unpublished) has
computed $\approx 60,000$ relative-periodic and pre-periodic orbits using
the numerical method described in the appendix of \refref{SCD07}. The
database of these solutions together with the corresponding Floquet
eigenvalues eigenvectors is available upon request.


\section{Basic notions\label{s:notions}}

the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation

evolution of $u=u(x,t)$ on a periodic domain $u(x,t) = u(x+L,t)$ is given
by
\beq
  u_t = F(u) = -{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(u^2)_x-u_{xx}-u_{xxxx}
    \,,\qquad   x \in [-L/2,L/2]
    \,.
\label{ks}
\eeq


In the Fourier representation
\beq
  u(x,t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_k (t) e^{ i k x /\tilde{L} }
\,,
\label{eq:ksexp}
\eeq
where $ \tilde{L} = 2\pi/L$, the equation takes the form
\beq
\dot{a}_k= v_k(a)
     = ( q_k^2 - q_k^4 )\, a_k
    - i \frac{q_k}{2} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_m a_{k-m}
\,,
\label{expan}
\eeq
where $q_k = k/\tilde{L}$. Since $u(x,t)$ is real, $a_k=a_{-k}^\ast$, and
we can replace the sum by a $k > 0$ sum.

It is convenient to represent complex modes as pairs of real variables,
either in cartesian or polar coordinates:
\[ a_k = (b_k, c_k) = b_k + ic_k = (r_k, \theta_k) = r_k e^{i\theta_k}
\,.
\]

$G$, the group of actions $ g \in G $ on a
state space (reflections, translations, \etc) is a symmetry of the KS
flow \refeq{ks} if $g\,u_t = F(g\,u)$.
The KS equation is time translationally invariant, and space translationally invariant
on a periodic domain under
the 1-parameter group of
$O(2): \{\Shift_{\shift/L},\Refl \}$.
If $u(x,t)$ is a solution, then
$\Shift_{\shift/L}\, u(x,t) = u(x+\shift,t)$
is an equivalent solution for any shift
$-L/2 < \shift \leq L/2$,
as is the
reflection (`parity' or `inversion')
\beq
    \Refl \, u(x) = -u(-x)
\,.
\label{KSparity}
\eeq
The translation operator action on the Fourier coefficients \refeq{eq:ksexp},
represented here by a complex valued vector
$a = \{a_k\in\mathbb{C}\,|\,k = 1, 2, \ldots\}$, is given by
\beq
  \Shift_{\shift/L}\, a = \mathbf{g}(\shift) \, a \,,
\label{eq:shiftFour}
\eeq
where $\mathbf{g}(\shift) = \mbox{diag}( e^{i q_k\, \shift} )$ is a complex
valued diagonal matrix, which amounts to the $k$-th mode complex plane
rotation by an angle $k\, \shift /\tilde{L}$.  The reflection acts on
the Fourier coefficients by complex conjugation,
\beq
  \Refl \, a = -a^\ast
\,.
\label{FModInvSymm}
\eeq
Reflection generates the dihedral subgroup $D_1 = \{1, \Refl\}$
of $O(2)$.

\subsection{Relative periodic and pre-periodic orbits}
\label{s:rpoNumerics}

As a result of invariance under $\Shift_{\shift/L}$,
KS equation can have \rpo\ solutions
with a profile $u_p(x)$, period $\period{p}$, and a
nonzero shift $\shift_p$
\beq
  u(x+\shift_p,\period{p}) = u(x,0) = u_p(x)
\,.
\label{eq:KSrpos}
\eeq
{\Rpo s} are periodic in
co-rotating frame rotating with phase velocity
$\velRel_p=\shift_p/\period{p}$, but in the stationary frame
their trajectories are quasiperiodic.  Due to the reflection symmetry
\refeq{KSparity} of KS equation, every {\rpo} $u_p(x)$ with shift
$\shift_p$ has a symmetric partner $-u_p(-x)$ with shift $-\shift_p$.

A \rpo\ will be periodic, \ie, $\shift_p = 0$, if it either {\bf (a)}
lives within the $\bbU^+$ antisymmetric subspace, $-u(-x,0) = u(x,0)$, or
{\bf (b)} returns to its reflection or its discrete rotation after a
period: $u(x,t+\period{p})=\gamma u(x,t)$, $\gamma^m=e$, and is thus
periodic with period $m\period{p}$. The dynamics of KS flow in the
antisymmetric subspace and \po s with symmetry {\bf (a)} have been
investigated previously\rf{Christiansen97,LanThesis,lanCvit07}. The KS
flow does not have any periodic orbits of this type for $L = 22$.

If field $u(x,t)$ in \KSe\  is interpreted as
`flame-front velocity', the time-dependent $L^2$ norm
of $u$,
\beq
  \expctE(t) = \Lint{\pSpace} \frac{u(t)^2}{2}
  \,,
  \label{ksEnergy}
\eeq
has a physical interpretation\rf{ksgreene88} as the average `energy'
density of the flame front, in analogy to the mean kinetic energy
density for the Navier-Stokes.
We shall use this `energy' norm to measure distance between pairs of states,
\beq
  \Norm{\ssp-\ssp'}^2  = \braket{\ssp-\ssp'}{\ssp-\ssp'} =
\Lint{\pSpace} ({u}-{u}')^2
\,.
\label{KSnorm} \eeq
The energy variation
\beq
   \dot{\expctE} = P - D
                \,,\qquad
      P =  \expct{u_{x}{}^2}
                \,,\quad
      D =  \expct{u_{xx}{}^2}
\label{EnRate} \eeq
balances the power $P$ pumped in by anti-diffusion $u_{xx}$ against the
energy dissipation rate $D$ by hyper-viscosity $u_{xxxx}$. The virtue of
energy norm \refeq{KSnorm} and the observables such as $P$ and $D$ is
that they are invariant (under the \SOn{2} symmetry transformations) and
representation independent.

A handful of the shortest \rpo s and pre-periodic orbits are listed in
    \reftab{tab:RPOs}.
For the lack of symbolic dynamics labeling of invariant solutions, we
refer to \rpo s as $\RPO{\period{}}$, labeled by the 3-4
significant digits of its period $\period{}$.
    \PC{2011-12-20 symmetries of eigenvectors in \reftab{tab:RPOs} mostly
    wrong - change them following \refref{SCD07}. Maybe move relative
    equilibria into a separate table. }
The short period \rpo s outline the coarse structure of the chaotic
attractor, while the longer period \rpo s resolve the finer details
of the dynamics. The shortest \rpo\ with
$\period{p} = 16.4$ is also the most unstable, with one positive
Floquet exponent equal 0.328.  The other short orbits are less
unstable, with the largest Floquet exponent in the range
0.018 -- 0.073, typical of the long time attractor average.


\section{From moving frames to invariant variables}

We begin by computing invariants for the ``standard action''
of $\SOn{2}$ on $\Clx{N}\cong\Rls{2N}$
which we write here as
% \beq
% 	\left(\barr{cc} \overline{b}_k \\ \overline{c}_k\earr \right)=\left(\barr{cc}
% 			    			\cos(k\theta) & -\sin(k\theta)\\
% 						\sin(k\theta) & \cos(k\theta)\\
% 			   			\earr	
% 						\right) \left(\barr{cc} b_k \\ c_k\earr\right)\,,\ \ k=1,\ldots N\,.
% 	\label{eq:SO2stand}
% \eeq
\bseq\label{eq:SO2stand}
  \begin{align}
	  \overline{b}_k &= \cos(k\theta)\,b_k - \sin(k\theta)\,c_k\,\label{eq:SO2stand1}\\
	  \overline{c}_k &= \sin(k\theta)\,b_k + \cos(k\theta)\,c_k\,,\label{eq:SO2stand2}
  \end{align}
\eseq
with $a_k=b_k+i c_k\,,\ b_k,c_k\in\Rls{}$ and $k=1,\ldots N$.
The choice of a slice is arbitrary; here we choose
\beq
 	\overline{c}_1=0\,,\qquad \overline{b}_1>0\,
\eeq
    \RLD{If it's all the same to you, I'd suggest to set
    $\overline{b}_1=0$, which would be consistent with the definition of
    antisymmetric subspace we used before.}
    \ES{It makes derivations (slightly) easier if I use this convention.
    I will keep it as it is and rethink at the end.}
    \PC{2011-12-28 Oh, back to the Greek-Ukrainian heresy... It's too long a
    story for a comment, but one should slice by choosing a \emph{physical} template:
    fixing the first Fourier coefficient $\overline{c}_1=0$ is good only for
    a neighborhood of $u(x,t) \approx 0$, the most unphysical of \eqva. But ignore
    my problem with this for now - let's see your slicing it works
    }
which leads to
\beq
	\overline{c}_1 = b_1\,\sin\theta + c_1\,\cos\theta  = 0\,
	\label{eq:SO2norm}
\eeq
and the ``moving frame''
\beq
	\theta=-\tan^{-1}\frac{c_1}{b_1}\,.
	\label{eq:SO2mf}
\eeq
Here $\tan^{-1}$ distinguishes quadrants, so that our choice of a slice
results to
\beq\label{eq:phi1}
  \theta=-\phi_1\,,
\eeq
where $\phi_1$ the polar angle in the $a_1$ Fourier
subspace.


Substituting \refeq{eq:phi1} in \refeq{eq:SO2stand} and using the
identity
$\alpha\cos(\phi)+\beta\sin(\phi)=\sqrt{\alpha^2+\beta^2}\cos(\phi-\tan^{-1}(\beta/\alpha))$
we get
\bseq\label{eq:SO2polar}
  \begin{align}
    \overline{b}_k &=
		    r_k\, \cos(\phi_k-k\,\phi_1)\,, \label{eq:SO2polar1}\\
    \overline{c}_k &=
		    r_k\, \sin(\phi_k-k\,\phi_1)\,,\label{eq:SO2polar2}
  \end{align}
\eseq
for $k=1,\ldots N$, where $r_k\equiv\sqrt{b_i^2+c_i^2}$, and
$\phi_k$ the polar angle in the $a_k$ Fourier subspace.
    \PC{2011-12-28 It's too long a story for a comment, but an
    invariant basis constructed from Fourier coefficients might be OK
    as long as it does not cause overflows/underflows for higher $k$. As it
    stands, for visualization it is only good only
    for a neighborhood of $u(x,t) \approx 0$, the most unphysical of
    \eqva.
    }
Note that for $k=1$ we get $\overline{b}_1=r_1,\, \overline{c}_1=0$.
Thus we have arrived at a system of $2N-1$ variables, which according to
theorems of Fels and Olver\rf{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99} are
$\SOn{2}$-invariant and functionally independent. They therefore serve the goal
of unique identification of group orbits, at least in the neighborhood of the
slice. We observe that \refeq{eq:SO2polar} are undefined at $r_1=0$,
a fact related to the familiar singularities of polar variables at the origin.
Tuckerman\rf{tuckerman89} showed that terms of the form $\psi_{n,k}(r,\phi)=r^n\exp(\ii\, k\,\phi)$
which appear in cylindrical coordinate $(r,\phi,z)$ discretizations of PDEs
are typically non-smooth at the origin. The problem is traced to rapid
oscillations of $\psi_{n,k}$ (with $\phi$) as $r\rightarrow0$ and Tuckerman\rf{tuckerman89} shows
that such oscillations are heavily damped near the origin for
$\psi_{n,k}$ with $n\geq k$. The prescription put forth by Tuckerman\rf{tuckerman89} to
construct a smooth basis for the numerical discretization of
PDEs is to keep only terms with $n\geq k$ (with some additional technical conditions).

The simplest way to modify variables \refeq{eq:SO2polar} to fulfill Tuckerman's
criterion is to multiply the right hand side by $r_1^k$. This would lead us to
work with invariant polynomials of order $k+1$ for the $k$'th Fourier subspace.
To see this, plug \refeq{eq:phi1} into \refeq{eq:SO2stand} to get
\bseq\label{eq:SO2cheb}
  \begin{align}
    \overline{b}_k &=
		    b_k\, \chebT_k\left(b_1/r_1\right)-
		    c_k\,\frac{c_1}{r_1} \chebU_{k-1}\left(b_1/r_1\right)\,, \label{eq:SO2cheb1}\\
    \overline{c}_k &=
		    b_k\, \frac{c_1}{r_1} \chebU_{k-1}\left(b_1/r_1\right)+
		    c_k\,\chebT_k\left(b_1/r_1\right)\,,  \label{eq:SO2cheb2}
  \end{align}
\eseq
where and $\chebT_k,\,\chebU_k$ are Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second type, respectively.
Therefore, multiplication by $r_1^k$ would result in highly deformed $a_k$ components
(and numerical underflow problems). Since our main goal is to investigate the
topology of the attractor we can instead aim at merely continuous or
differentiable transformations.
% Note also, that the introduction of a fundamental domain for discrete symmetry
% reduction destroys smoothness of the transformations, even if it is initially
% imposed in continuous symmetry reduction.

Thus, we multiply the right-hand side of \refeq{eq:SO2polar} with a monotonic function
$h_\epsilon(r_1)$ which satisfies $h_\epsilon(0)=0$,
has a convergent Maclaurin series for $0<r_1<\infty$,
and may depend on a parameter $\epsilon$.
Our modified set of $SO(2)$-invariants reads
\bseq\label{eq:SO2polarCont}
  \begin{align}
    \tilde{b}_k &=
		    h_\epsilon(r_1)\,\overline{b}_k\,, \label{eq:SO2polarCont1}\\
    \tilde{c}_k &=
		    h_\epsilon(r_1)\,\overline{c}_k\,, \quad k=1,\ldots,N.\label{eq:SO2polarCont2}
  \end{align}
\eseq
A simple choice for $h_\epsilon$ is
%are $h_\epsilon(r_1)=r_1$ which would lead to
%transformations \refeq{eq:SO2polarCont} continuous at $r_1=0$,
%and
$h_\epsilon(r_1)=r_1^2$ which would lead to differentiable transformations \refeq{eq:SO2polarCont}.
One can easily show that, with the above requirements,
\refeq{eq:SO2polarCont} are linearly independent. However,
\refeq{eq:SO2polarCont} maps any point in the subspace $r_1=0$ to zero, \ie\
\refeq{eq:SO2polarCont} do not provide a complete basis for the reduced space.
This a rather serious limitation, since non-trivial $N$-cell equilibria of
KSe are mapped to the origin under \refeq{eq:SO2polarCont}.

This difficulty suggests extending \refeq{eq:SO2polarCont} by including $2N-2$ additional linearly
independent invariant variables which do not vanish at $r_1=0$. To this end, we write
the transformations resulting from defining a slice $c_m=0,\, b_m>0$ for any $1<m\leq N$:
\bseq\label{eq:SO2polarAny}
  \begin{align}
    \overline{b}_k &=
		    r_k\, \cos\left(\phi_k-\left(k/m\right)\phi_m\right)\,, \label{eq:SO2polarAny1}\\
    \overline{c}_k &=
		    r_k\, \sin\left(\phi_k-\left(k/m\right)\phi_m\right)\,,\label{eq:SO2polarAny2}
  \end{align}
\eseq
for $k=1,\ldots N$. As before, we multiply variables \refeq{eq:SO2polarAny} by $h_\epsilon(r_m)$.
However, we have to note that only variables with $k=n\,m$, where $n$ integer, are well behaved.
Thus our basis reads
\bseq\label{eq:SO2polarExt}
\begin{align}
  \tilde{b}_{nm} &=
		  h_\epsilon(r_m)r_{nm}\, \cos\left(\phi_{nm}-n\phi_m\right)\,, \label{eq:SO2polarExt1}\\
  \tilde{c}_{nm} &=
		  h_\epsilon(r_m)r_{nm}\, \sin\left(\phi_{nm}-n\phi_m\right)\,,\label{eq:SO2polarExt2}
\end{align}
\eseq
$m=1,...,M$, $n=1,\ldots\lfloor N/m\rfloor$ and $M$ is the smallest integer that
satisfies $\sum_{m=2}^M(2\lfloor N/m\rfloor-1)\geq2N-2$ and for
$m=M$ we have $n=1,\ldots,\sum_{m=2}^M(2\lfloor N/m\rfloor-1)-(2N-2)$.

    \RLD{2012-01-06: I find it rather hard to follow what exactly you are doing above.
I'm wondering whether it is possible to have something more straightforward.
For example, reading \rf{AGHO288} awhile ago, I was thinking we could just use their SO(2) invariant variables.
For the 1st and 2nd Fourier modes, they take $|a_1|^2$, $|a_2|^2$, and $a_1^2 \bar{a_2} + \bar{a_1}^2 a_2 = 2 r_1^2 r_2 \cos(2\theta_1 - \theta_2)$,
where I use overbar to denote complex conjugate.  For every additional mode $k$, we can add two more variables:
$|a_k|^2 = r_k^2$ and $a_1^k \bar{a_k} + \bar{a_1}^k a_k = 2 r_1^k r_k \cos(k\theta_1 - \theta_k)$.
In these variables the equilibria will not collapse into the origin.
    }
    \ES{I think it was the basis in\rf{AGHO288} the one which inspired Jonathan Halcrow to propose a similar basis for KS but coupling
each Fourier mode with the previous one (this was sometime in 2007? I have to check his blog).
This was rejected by Predrag because it would lead to invariant polynomials of very high order.
The same is true with what you propose here (factors of $r_1^k$). Also note that $r_1^k r_k \cos(k\theta_1 - \theta_k)$
coincides with what I call Tuckermann's prescription.
From a computational perspective I think there could be problems with over/underflows and this is why I don't like this
approach.
On the other hand, nonlinear nature of such transformations does not seem a problem to me: as long as the topology is respected
we should be able to get the correct return maps.
So what I propose is instead of $r_1^k r_k \cos(k\theta_1 - \theta_k)$ to use $r_1 r_k \cos(k\theta_1 - \theta_k)$ or
$r_1^2 r_k \cos(k\theta_1 - \theta_k)$ or $(1-e^{-r_1^2/\epsilon}) r_k \cos(k\theta_1 - \theta_k)$.

If we use $|a_k|^2 = r_k^2$ instead of $\sin(...)$ you are right that equilibria do not collapse to the origin
for $r_1=0$.
However, for $r_1=0$ we are only left with the magnitudes as invariant variables, which means that
two points which in the original space are not related by rotations
(their phase difference does not match for all Fourier modes) might be represented by the same point
in reduced space.
This is why I propose to add more variables which depend on the relative phases. Once we add a third Fourier mode
in the variables of \rf{AGHO288} we need to track phase difference of second and third mode when $r_1=0$. The
problem is that if we use $r_2 r_3 cos(\phi_2-2\phi_3/3)$ for this there seems to be some residual discrete symmetry which
results in jumps in reduced space. This is why things tend to get a bit more complicated.

Unfortunately, \ref{eq:SO2polarExt} is still problematic since any prime number larger than $M$ is only coupled to
the first Fourier mode. So I am now leaning towards a choice of the form:
\bseq
  \begin{align}
    		    h_\epsilon(r_1)\,r_k\, 	\begin{cases} 	
						    \cos(\phi_k-k\,\phi_1)\,, \qquad k\, \mathrm{even}\\
						    \sin(\phi_k-k\,\phi_1)\,, \qquad k\, \mathrm{odd}
					\end{cases}\\
		    h_\epsilon(r_k)\,r_{2k}\, \cos(\phi_{2k}-2\,\phi_k)\,,\\
		    r_k^2\,,
% 		    h_\epsilon(r_k)\,r_{2k}\, \sin(\phi_{2k}-2\,\phi_k)\,,
  \end{align}
\eseq
$k=2,\ldots,N/2$, where we choose $\sin(...)$ or $\cos(..)$ depending on which one is reflection equivariant and for $k=1$ we have
simply $r_1^2$. For this to work we must be able to ignore modes with $k>N/2$, which is certainly true for our KS simulations with $N=32$. Here,
in order to loose information for the relative phase of a mode we must have at the same time $r_1=0$ and $r_{2k}=0$,
which is a lower dimensional subspace (3 conditions instead of 1) and therefore harder to visit. Choices for $h_\epsilon$
would be $h_\epsilon(r_k)=(1-e^{-r_k^2/\epsilon})$ or $h_\epsilon(r_k)=r_k^2$.
    }

Variables \refeq{eq:SO2polarExt} are linearly, but not functionally independent. Therefore increase
in reduced space dimensionality is only apparent.
\ES{Here we could project back to $2N-1$ dimensions
through a linear transformation \emph{ala} Gilmore\rf{GL-Gil07b}. Another option is careful counting
of functional dependencies to figure out if we can simply pick $2N-1$ variables.}

Under reflections $\Refl a_k \mapsto-b_k+\ii c_k$ we see that

\section{Symmetry reduced state space}


For all numerical results presented in this section we pick
$h_\epsilon(r_k)=(1-e^{-r_k^2/\epsilon})$ with $\epsilon=0.2$. This choice
scales as $r_k^2$ for $r_k\rightarrow 0$, thus ensuring differentiability
of \refeq{eq:SO2polarExt}, while for large $r_k$ distortion of
trajectories is minimal. For $N=32$ used in our simulations, we find $M=4$.

\section{Conclusions}

Motivating \refeq{eq:SO2polarExt}
is still rough around the edges, but the final result is
1) easily seen to be $\SOn{2}$-invariant,
%     \PC{2011-12-28 $\On{2}$- or $\SOn{2}$-invariant? Basis seems
%     $\On{2}$-equivariant, according to \refeq{eq:SO2chebRefl}?}
2) easily and economically
implemented numerically, requiring no computer algebra, 3) it scales well
with the dimension of phase space, 4) it is global requires no further
thinking of singularities and can thus be used in automated searches for
neighboring orbits in sets of thousands orbits. This is how commencing with the
organization of relative periodic orbits in families, as in \reffig{f:rpo_shad},
became possible.

%
% A simple choice is
% \beq\label{eq:SO2polarMag}
%     \tilde{q}_k =
% 		    g_\delta(r_1^2)\,r_k^2\,, \qquad k=2,\ldots,N,
% \eeq
% where $g_\delta(r_1)$ is monotonic, satisfies $g_\delta(0)\neq0$,
% has a convergent Maclaurin series for $0<r_1<\infty$ and
% may depend on a parameter $\delta$.
% % and has to be chosen such that \refeq{eq:SO2polarCont}
% % and \refeq{eq:SO2polarMag} are linearly independent. To fulfill the latter requirement,
% % it is sufficient to choose $g_\delta(r_1)$ such that
% Under these assumptions we can easily show that \refeq{eq:SO2polarMag} and
% \refeq{eq:SO2polarCont} are linearly independent. A simple choice which serves our purposes
% is  $g_\delta(r_1^2)=1$. However, the freedom in choosing more general $g_\delta(r_1^2)$ will be used
% in the following to keep the nonlinear deformation of state-space portraits by the introduction
% of \refeq{eq:SO2polarMag} to a minimum. Eventhough the introduction of
% $N-1$ variables \refeq{eq:SO2polarMag} leads to an apparent increase of state-space dimension,
% we have to note that $\tilde{q}_k$ are not functionally independent from $\tilde{b}_k$
% and $\tilde{c}_k$, since they satisfy $N-1$ relations
% \beq\label{eq:SO2polarSyz}
%   \tilde{q}_k\,h_\epsilon^2(\tilde{b}_1^2+\tilde{c}_1^2) = (\tilde{b}_k^2+\tilde{c}_k^2)\,g_\delta(\tilde{b}_1^2+\tilde{c}_1^2)\,,\quad k=2,\ldots,N.

% Relations \refeq{eq:SO2polarSyz} describe the manner in which the $(2N-1)$-dimensional reduced space is embedded in
% $(3N-2)$-dimensional space of $\tilde{b}_k,\tilde{c}_k,\tilde{q}_k$.

% However, even with the introduction of $\tilde{q}_k$ we still fail to span $r_1=0$,
% since points in reduced space are not identified by the $r_k$ alone (\ie\ there are
% $N-1$ variables which depend on appropriate differences of $\theta_k$ missing).
% A strategy towards constructing a complete basis is outlined in the Appendix.
% For the example of \KSe, however, we note that completeness is not essential;
% points with $r_1=0$ in the dynamically important antisymmetric subspace are
% uniquely identified by $q_k$.
