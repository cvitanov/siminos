This project is organized as follows.
In \refsect{chap:KS}, we recall some basic facts about the \KS\ dissipative
system studied in this project, and in
\refsect{sect:KSsym} we discuss its symmetries.
% \refsect{sec:symReduce} discusses the slicing technique we use to reduce
% continuous symmetries of dynamical systems, and the tangent dynamics in the
% slice.
%Methods of \refsect{sect:KSsym} are a prerequisite to the calculations of
%\refsect{chap:ks}, where we study invariant structures in the
%symmetry-reduced \statesp\ of the one\dmn\ \KSe.

\refSect{chap:KSmichelson} and \refsect{chap:KSyang} describe the main
result of this project: the finite differencing method used by
Michelson\rf{Mks86} is reproduced to find a particular solution. We also
attempt to apply Yang's linearization method to the \KSe, and formulate the
first steps toward a Newton-correction equation that could be used to find
solutions numerically.
We summarize our results and outline some future directions in
\refsect{sect:summary}.
