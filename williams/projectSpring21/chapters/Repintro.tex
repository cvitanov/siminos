Here we start by studying \reqv\ solutions of the \KS\ system for $L=22$ minimal
cell\rf{SCD07,lanCvit07}, where  the dynamical system is sufficiently small
that we can think of it as a low-dimensional, or a ``few-body'' system in
Gutkin and Richter\rf{EPUR14,EDASRU14,EnUrRi15,EDUR15} condensed matter
parlance, in the limit where the columns in the Gutkin and Osipov %\rf{GutOsi15}
$2D$ symbolic dynamics spatiotemporal table
%(not a 1\dmn\ symbol sequence block), a column whose
% temporal symbolic dynamics we will know, sooner or later.
take constant values, \ie, spatial solutions are temporally steady.
Michelson\rf{Mks86} then describes the bottom row. The full Michelson \statesp\
is 4\dmn\ (3-dimensional dynamics plus a parameter), and, in addition to the
translation equivariance, it is reflection equivariant which makes it \On{2}
equivariant, so slicing together with a \Zn{2} symmetry reduction is required.

The goal of this project was to determine at least one, and hopefully a set of
{\rpo}s of the shortest periods in both the time and the space directions (with
no imposition of a fixed, finite length $L$ periodic spatial domain). However,
within the time frame of the project, I was only able to verify a Michelson
calculation of one particular \reqv\ solution, and I was not able to assign to
this solution any symbol plane, or proceed to calculation of any
spatiotemporally varying \po\ or \rpo\ solutions.
