Abstract :

High-dimensional or even infinite-dimensional nonlinear dissipative systems usually have complicated flow in the phase space (state space). Invariant subsets inside such systems, such as equilibria, periodic orbits, invariant tori and unstable manifolds, play the key role in shaping the geometry of the global attractor in the state space. They form the backbone of the state space and their stability tells us the nearby dynamics.

For my research, I study the geometrical structure of the inertial manifold in nonlinear dissipative systems. As an exponentially attracting and positive-invariant subset of the state space, inertial manifold serves as a tool to reduce the study of an infinite-dimensional system to the study of a finite set of determining modes. Specifically, I investigate the dimension of the inertial manifold in the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by using the information of the linear stability of pre/relative periodic orbits inside this system. To achieve this goal, we need an effective algorithm to calculate the Floquet multipliers and Floquet vectors of a periodic orbit. On the other hand, the O2 symmetry in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation complicates the geometrical structure of the global attractor, so innovative symmetry reduction technique is required to obtain a simplified picture of the system. The main result is that the estimated dimension of the inertial manifold is 8 for one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation defined on a periodic domain of size $L=22$.
