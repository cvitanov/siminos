Assortment of variational Newton descent codes.

Ignoring the prefix "MNG", the codes can be described as such:

rosslervnd: Find periodic orbits of the Rossler system of equations

vndrosslerfunc: Functions imported by rosslervnd

vndanti: Find periodic orbits in time that lie in the antisymmetric
subspace of solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation

vndfunctionsanti: Functions imported by vndanti

vndtime: Find periodic orbits in time that lie in the full
state space of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation

vndfunctionstime: Functions imported by vndtime

vndspace: Find spatially-periodic orbits that lie in the full state-space
of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.

vndfunctionsspace: Functions imported by vndspace.
