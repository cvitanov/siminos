Title of Presentation:

Estimating the Dimension of an Inertial Manifold from Unstable Periodic Orbits

Abstract:

We provide numerical evidence that a finite-dimensional inertial manifold on which the dynamics of a chaotic dissipative dynamical system lives can be constructed solely from the knowledge of a set of unstable periodic orbits. In particular, we determine the dimension of the inertial manifold for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system and find it to be equal to the “physical dimension” computed previously via the hyperbolicity properties of covariant Lyapunov vectors.

Dear Mr. Ding,
 
We regret to inform you that we are not able to award you a SIAM Student Travel Award for travel to the SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems (DS17).
 
We begin every year with a set number of awards to give, and the awards are allocated to each conference at the beginning of the year. For the Dynamical Systems conference (DS17), we received  close to twice as many applications as we had awards to give.  All the applications we received were strong, and we are disappointed that not all of them could win a travel award.
 
We hope that you will be able to find other means of funding your attendance at DS17 and that you will enjoy the conference. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Joanna Littleton

Presentation Title: Estimating the Dimension of An Inertial Manifold from Unstable Periodic Orbits
 
Dear Xiong Ding,
 
Thank you for your recent submission to the SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems (DS17), May 21-25, 2017, at the Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort, Snowbird, Utah, USA. 
 
Unfortunately, due to a record number of proposals, the organizers regret they are unable to accept all submissions in the format they were submitted. For this reason, some submissions have been converted from a lecture into a poster.
 
The talk listed above, originally submitted as a contributed lecture, has been converted into a poster. As such, it will be scheduled in a Poster Session during the conference. Please notify your co-authors of the change in format. Official acceptance notices will be sent under separate cover later this month.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thank you.
 
Sincerely,
Kirsten Wilden, CMP
