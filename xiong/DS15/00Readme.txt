SIAM Conference on Application of Dynamical Systems

Abstract:

As an extension of periodic Schur decomposition, periodic eigendecomposition is
capable of calculating Floquet spectrum and Floquet vectors along periodic orbits
in chaotic systems accurately.  Its effectiveness, and in particular its ability
to resolve eigenvalues whose magnitude differs by hundreds of orders, is
demonstrated by applying the algorithm to computation of the full linear stability
spectrum of periodic solutions of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system. Also, its efficiency
is compared with the existing 
covariant vectors algorithm.

Notification from DS15

[2014-11-15]
Dear Xiong Ding, 

You have submitted two proposals to the SIAM Conference on
Applications of Dynamical Systems (DS15) with the same title
and abstract. One was submitted as a lecture, and one was 
submitted as a poster. Which submission is correct? 

Lecture: Periodic Eigendecomposition and Its Application in Nonlinear Dynamics

Poster: Periodic Eigendecomposition and Its Application in Nonlinear Dynamics 

Please let me know as soon as possible. 

Thank you.
Sincerely,

Hi Kirsten Wilden,

I submitted the same proposal for both sections
because I want to give a talk, but, at the same time,
I am not sure whether the material I am going to
present matches  the theme of this conference exactly.
So it is up to the conference committee to determine which
section is more suitable for me.
Here is an arXiv manuscript on which my poster/talk will be based:
http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4885

I am sorry to confuse you. If you find hard to make the decision,
then just put me in the poster section.

Best Regards,
Xiong Ding

Dear Xiong, 

I will inform the organizers you would like them to determine
where the proposal best fits.

Predrag CvitanoviÄ‡.

The deadline for application updates for this conference is: November
17, 2014.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to email us 
at TravelAwards@SIAM.org. Please include the conference code, "DS15"
in the subject line.

Thank you,

Dear Xiong,

The conference co-chairs have placed your submission in a lecture
session. As such, I have deleted your poster submission from the
system.

Official acceptance notices and scheduling information will
be sent in mid-January.

Sincerely,

Kirsten

Travel award application is rejected.

Dear Mr. Ding,

We regret to inform you that we are not able to award you a SIAM
Student Travel Award for travel to the SIAM Conference on Applications
of Dynamical Systems (DS15), to be held May 17-21, 2015 in Snowbird Ski
and Summer Resort in Snowbird, Utah.

Your application was placed for a brief time on a waiting list in case 
further funding became available.  I regret to say it has not.  However,
we will move to this list if there should be any cancellations and awards
open up.  Please excuse my delay in writing during this time.

We begin every year with a set number of awards to give, and the awards are
allocated to each conference at the beginning of the year.  For the Dynamical
Systems conference (DS15), we received over twice as many applications as we had 
awards to give.  All the applications we received were strong, and we are
disappointed that not all of them could win a travel award.

Thank you for your interest in the SIAM Student Travel Awards.  We encourage you 
to continue to apply for travel awards to future SIAM conferences as you progress
through your academic program. 

We hope that you will be able to find other means of funding your attendance at 
DS15 and that you will enjoy the conference. 

Sincerely,

Joanna Littleton

Confirmation to give a lecture.


Dear Contributed Speakers:

The submissions listed at http://meetings.siam.org/program.cfm?CONFCODE=ds15 are accepted and scheduled
for presentation at the SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems (DS15), being held May 17-21, 
2015 at the Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort in Snowbird, Utah, USA.

See when your session or talk is scheduled by visiting the speaker and organizer index.  Every effort has
been made to minimize conflicts, however, if one occurs please do your best to resolve the conflict by
having a co-author present.

 

To participate at the conference follow these steps:

1. Check information of importance to you (name, affiliation, talk title, abstract)! Visit the website to
see how your name, affiliation and talk title are recorded for this conference.  THIS INFORMATION IS BEING
USED FOR PUBLICATION ON THE CONFERENCE WEB SITE AND WILL BE USED FOR THE FINAL PRINTED PROGRAM.

Visit http://meetings.siam.org/start.cfm?CONFCODE=ds15 to edit (or add) co-author information, talk titles, 
abstracts and/or contact information.  Affiliation changes must be sent directly to Jennifer Fasy (fasy@siam.org) 
*after* you have updated your contact information using the above link.  (Note: affiliation changes will not appear
on the on-line web program until received and processed by Jennifer in the SIAM office).

Be sure final abstracts and titles are submitted by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on Monday, March 9, 2015.  Only cancellations
and replacement speakers will be updated after this time.

Individuals are limited to one presentation, either a minisymposium, a contributed talk or a poster presentation. Replacement
speakers must not be already scheduled to give a talk to ensure compliance with this one-talk-per-speaker rule.

2. Avoid cancellation and complete your registration by Monday, April 20, 2015!  Failure to register by the 4:00 PM
Eastern Time deadline may result in the cancellation of your presentation.  An email will be sent to you when online 
registration opens in February.

In addition to the items above, remember to make your hotel reservations, travel arrangements and review SIAM's
audio visual policy. LCD projectors will be available in each breakout room, however, speakers are responsible for
providing their own laptops. Overhead projectors are available by request only.  If you need an overhead projector be
sure to email fasy@siam.org by Monday, April 20, 2015 to request one. 

 

The hotel reservation deadline is Monday, April 20, 2015.  Be sure to mention you are attending the SIAM Conference to
qualify for the reduced room rate ($145 plus taxes in the Lodge at Snowbird or the Inn; $150 plus taxes in the Cliff Lodge).

 

Thank you for your interest in SIAM conferences. We look forward to your participation.

With best regards,
