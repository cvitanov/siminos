\section{Reading List}
\label{sect:readlist}

I create a list to record the papers I have read, for the purpose of
recording what I have learned from these geniuses.

  \textbf{Ergodic theory of chaos and strange attractors}\rf{EckmannRuelle1985}.\\
  This is a very comprehensive review paper which summarizes various aspects
  of ergodic systems, such as definition of attractor/strange attractor,
  information dimension, Lyapunov exponents, invariant measures, etc.
  It helps resolve my confusion about attractor and strange attractor.
  Meanwhile, at chapter V section C, the QR algorithm of calculating
  Lyapunov exponents is reviewed, and the authors also propose a method
  to calculate invariant subspaces corresponding to a subset of Lyapunov
  exponents. I am not sure whether Ginelli, etc, were inspired by this
  paper when they tried to formulate the Covariant vectors algorithm.
  Needless to say, this paper is highly recommended.
