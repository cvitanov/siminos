Hints for Writing a Good Summary

   1. Be brief. As a guide, 200 words is usually enough, while many summaries are complete with 150 words. The publications only need a relatively shallow description of the work to decide whether to look at the manuscript. Shorter summaries are usually better because they include fewer details that tend to distract from the main points.
      2. Try to get to the "bottom line" in the first sentence or two before stepping back to go over background information. Don't make them read a lot of background before getting to the point. Think of the way a newspaper article is written, with the most important points at the top.
         3. Aim your summary at the general public, not physicists. Some of the summary readers are not physicists, and it helps all of them to visualize how the topic could be presented to a general audience. Avoid or define any jargon. State why your result is important in direct terms, even if it seems obvious. Using simple terms will not insult the readers' intelligence and will also be appreciated by your institution's public information or press office.
	    4. Clearly distinguish between what is new in your paper and what is merely background information. Your summary may contain some brief discussion of previous work, but make it obvious where you are switching to discussing the new work. Phrases like "In this paper, we . . ." are helpful as an indication of this transition.
