I would like to sincerely thank my advisor Prof. Predrag Cvitanovi\'c for
his persistent and patient guidance in the past few years.
He introduced me to the research of chaos, a fascinating field of 
physics. And I learned a lot from him about turbulence theory, 
cycle-averaging theory, group theory and so on. I really
appreciate the resources he is providing for graduate students
working at \emph{Center for Nonlinear Science} at \emph{Georgia Tech}.
Especially, I admire his attitude of regarding studying and researching
as lifetime habits.

At the same time, I thank everyone who has assisted my research.
I thank Prof. Flavio Fenton for his guidance on the heart dynamics 
when I was trying different research topics. 
I thank Prof. Luca Dieci for his valuable suggestions on the \ped\ 
algorithm. I thank Prof. Sung Ha Kang for her guidance in the adaptive 
time-stepping exponential integrators.
I thank my colleague Matthew Gudorf for proofreading my thesis.
I thank my classmate Nazmi Burak Budanur for the 
discussions of symmetry reduction. 
I thank Mohammad Farazmand, Christopher Marcotte, Han Li,
Simon Berman, Kimberly Short,
Pallantla Ravi Kumar and other colleagues 
for all the enlightening discussions.


At last, I thank my parents for insisting that I pursue 
higher education, and the efforts they made to make it possible.
