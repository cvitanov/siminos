The study of nonlinear dynamics covers a huge range of research topics.
In this thesis, we focus on the geometric or topological structures and
statistic averages of dissipative systems. The progress in this area comes
from collaborative contributions from both applied mathematicians and
physicists, from both theoretical and numerical aspects.
In this chapter, we introduce the mathematical framework to study the
finite\dmn\ behavior embedded in an infinite\dmn\ function
space of dissipative systems described by nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs).
In particular, we review the recent progress in use of ``covariant vectors'' for
investigating the dimensionality of chaotic systems.
We also focus on the important role that invariant structures such as \po s
play in the description of chaotic dynamics and review the \emph{cycle averaging
theory}\rf{DasBuch} for calculating statistical properties of chaotic
dynamical systems.
