The authors introduce a new algorithm to compute the full spectrum
of Floquet vectors over generic periodic orbits. In a sense, this
is a generalization of analogous algorithms (in particular the
dynamical one based on QR decomposition of Ginelli et al)
introduced for the computation of covariant Lyapunov vectors
(Oseledets splitting) over ergodic orbits of chaotic systems. This
new method, adapted to periodic orbits, is based on a clever
reordering of periodic Schur decomposition. In particular, its
use allows one to resolve conjugate pairs of Floquet vectors that
can arise in periodic orbits. To the best of my knowledge, this
method looks correct and efficient.

The method is then applied to the study of the periodic orbits
embedded in the chaotic attractor of the well-known
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation. This Floquet vector analysis
evidences a decomposition of the Floquet spectrum between a finite
number of "entangled modes" and a residual set of strongly
contracting residual modes. This confirms earlier results of
Takeuchi et al, where an analogous separation between "physical"
and "spurious" modes has been detected in the covariant Lyapunov
spectrum of the ergodic trajectories of the KS equation. This in an
interesting work from the technical point of view, while the
application to KS embedded unstable periodic orbits confirms that
information relevant to the ergodic attractor can be also extracted
by the analysis of the unstable periodic orbits embedded in it.
