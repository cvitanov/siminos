First of all, we would like to thank the referees for careful reading
of our manuscript.  In summary, Referees 1 and 2 both support the
publication of this manuscript in SIADS (after revisions).

This is my first time to write a scientific article and try to make it
easy to follow. But, in the first submission, I made a few avoidable 
mistakes, like typos and ambiguous expressions. It is a good lesson for 
me to understand that such errors will waste editors' and referees' 
valuable time.

The main issues pointed out by referee 1 are, first, the readability for 
physicists and engineers, and second, there is one logical error in
iteration method at the second stage of periodic eigendecomposition.
The latter issue is fixed. Also, We replaced one illustration figure 
and avoid using too many technical terminologies to make the manuscript 
sound and easy to follow.

Assuming that the revisions meet the reviewers' approval, we look
forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,
