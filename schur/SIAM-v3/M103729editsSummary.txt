    Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system,
    by Xiong Ding and Predrag Cvitanovi\'c

Summary of edits, revision of Mar 28, 2016
==========================================
The revised text is highlighted in red in DingCvit14-v3.pdf, attached

- We have changed "covariant vectors" to "covariant Lyapunov vectors" 
  to make the term consistent with the literature.

- We deleted the sentence about dimension of inertial manifold in the 
  abstract as suggested by Referee 1. Also, other places, like section 
  2 paragraph 2, paragraph on 1 on page 16, paragraph 1 on page 18,
  caption of figure 3 and so on, have been rewritten to avoid too much 
  exposition to inertial manifold. 

- We replaced Fig2 suggested by Referee 1, since the old one is hard 
  to understand. 

- We corrected a severe misleading statement that the iteration method
  is not able to obtain eigenvectors for all $R^{(k)}$ simultaneously.

- In complexity analysis (section 6), we refer to equations and figures,
  as suggested by Referee 1.

- Indices for invariant subspaces of backward Oseledets matrix in section
  2.2 are corrected.

- We modified the definition of Floquet exponent and its real part to make
  the terminologies clearer.

- Backward dynamics in the covariant Lyapunov vector algorithm is slightly
  modified to take into account the normalization detail.

- We have changed "xxx.etc" to "xxx.et al." when citing reference which 
  has a few authors.

- We added a footnote for ceiling function on page 17.

- We removed the sentence about our future publication in the conclusion 
  section (section 8).

- We added Ref[32] since chapter 8 of this book discusses various aspects
  of product eigenvalue problem.

- We added Ref[28] and use it section 2 paragraph 2 : "physical dimension
  of the inertial manifold[28, 29]".

- We added Ref[14] to Covariant Lyapunov vector algorithm when we mention
  the authors Ginelli et al., as suggested by Referee 1.

- Some other references about Covariant Lyapunov vector algorithm are 
  removed since they are not directly related to the formulation of this
  algorithm.

- Other changes, like typos, rephrases are not included here. Some important
  ones are colored red in the revised version.
