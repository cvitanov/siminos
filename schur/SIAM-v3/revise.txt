1. Initially, we thought that materials on the study of effective dimension of inertial manifold can effectively express our desire to compute Floquet vectors, but the feedback indicates that it is too much. So we get rid of the sentence about the inertial manifold research in the abstract, and also
rewrite Sec2, P2 to emphasize our motivation of studying Floquet vectors of periodic orbits without too much exposition to the research on effective dimension of inertial manifold. 

Other places that are modified accordingly: 
1) paragraph 1 on page 16 : avoid mentioning "inertial manifold".
2) paragraph 1 in page 18 : remove "physical modes".
3) Caption of Figure 3 : replace "entangled modes" with "exponents"
4) Caption of Table 1: remove the sentence talking about "entangled modes"
   and "isolated modes"

Places that we think it is better to keep:
1) paragraph 2 in page 16: We mention the experiments conducted on covariant Lyapunov vectors and expect Floquet vectors may serve the same purpose and propose our future work.
2) In the conclusion part for future work : we mention our goal to determine the physical dimension of a turbulent Navier-Stokes flow.

2. We replace Fig.2 with a new one which illustrates the 2 stages of periodic Schur decomposition of three [6x6] matrices. Compared with the vague old one, this new figure is more straightforward and labels 2 stages explicitly. Also, the 2nd paragraph of section 2.4 is rewritten to avoid some technical details and the convergence properties. Readers can obtain all details from the references cited in this paragraph.

3. $R_m$ being quasi-upper triangular is an assumption without lose of generality. One may think that simultaneous iteration for $J^{(k)}$ will make $R_k$ quasi-upper triangular. Such a concern is sensible because in equation (4.2) we absorb matrix $D$ into $R^{(0)}$. However, this is only performed for $R^{(0)}$ not for other $R^{(k)}$. So after one iteration, $Q_0$ rotates to $Q'_0$ and is rotated back to $Q_0$ intentionally, and all other $Q_i$ do not change. This point is critical because equation (3.3) should be uniform for all $J^{(k)}$. 

We changed the sentences under equation (4.1) and (4.2) to explain our choice of $R_m$. If you think we are wrong, we can discuss again.

4. This is our severe mistake.  We made the following changes:
   1) Add a few sentences at the end of the 1st paragraph of section 5.1 to indicate how power iteration generates eigenvectors of all $R^{(k)}$ simultaneously.
   2) Remove the first paragraph of section 5.2 which talks about the drawbacks of iteration method.
   3) Remove the sentences talking about the drawbacks of iteration method in the 3rd paragraph in section 6.
   4) Delete the statement under formula (3.5) about the ieration method.

5. Substantial changes have been made to section 6. We refer to equations or figures to each complexity expression. Only high-lever processes are discussed and a lot details, like Householder transformation and Givens rotation, are hidden. The details are covered in any numerical linear algebra book, and the reader can get them from the references provided in that section. Also, we correct the complexity of GEPP from $O(mn^2)$ in general to $O(mi^2)$ for the i-th eigenvalue. 


6. 1) We think "real part" is correct. When written in exponential form,  Floquet multipliers are $\Lambda_j = \exp(T \mu_j + i\theta)$, so $\mu$ is the real part in the exponent and it determines the magnitude of $\Lambda_j$. Maybe our phrasing is misleading, so the 3 lines above equation (2.2) are slightly changed. We can discuss it if you have different opinion.

   2) Yes, we made a mistake about the indices of forward/back invariant subspaces of Oseledets matrices. We correct them following the style in Ref.[30]. Also, we change the '+' symbol to '\oplus' to emphasize that it is direct sum of subspaces.

   3) Yes, we made a mistake about the symbol reserved for eigenvectors. $v_i^{(k)}$ are eigenvectors of $R^{(k)}$, while $e_i^{(k)}$ are eigenvectors of $J^{(k)}$. So, $v_i$ are all replaced by $e_i$ in section 4.  
   
   4) Typos such as "figure figure 1" are corrected.

7. 1) We add Ref[14] at page 1, 4 and 5; all the places where mention Gineelli et al.'s work.
   
   2) When we say "these two methods are equivalent", we are not referring to simultaneous iteration and covariant Lyapunov vector algorithm. Actually, we try to say "simultaneous iteration is equivalent to periodic Schur decomposition algorithm". We changed the phrasing here to make it clearer. 

   The new version is 
   "Actually, for a single matrix, simultaneous iteration is equivalent to $QR$ iteration. When it comes to matrix product, simultaneous iteration and periodic Schur decomposition both achieve the PRSF, but their computational complexities differ."


------------------------------------------------------------
Other changes:

1. Change "covariant vectors" to "covariant Lyapunov vectors" in the abstract and main text to make the term consistent with literature.

2. Change xx.etc to xxx.et al. when citing one paper which has a few authors.

3. Add a footnote for ceiling function in page 17. 

4. remove the sentence about our future publication in the section 8.
   "as well as in the forthcoming publication". 

5. References 

   2) Add Ref.[36] and use it in Sec1, p1 "periodic Schur decomposition(PSD)[3, 36]". 
   The reason is that Chapter 8 of this book discusses various aspect of product eigenvalue problem, which is useful for readers interested in PSD.
   
   3) Add Ref.[28] and use it section 2 paragraph 2 : "physical dimension
    of the inertial manifold[28, 29]".
   The reason that this reference is far easier to follow than the more mathematical book Ref[34].
