Dear Xiong Ding:

We have received referee reports on your manuscript "Periodic
eigendecomposition and its application to Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
system" (MS#M103729), which are attached. Your paper may merit
publication in SIADS after minor revision.

We ask that you respond to the referees' suggestions and submit a
suitably revised version. When you submit the revision, please
include a list of the changes you made and a response to the
reviewers' comments as this helps us and the reviewers assessing
your revision.

In an effort to shorten time to publication, we ask that you submit
your revised manuscript within the next month by March 31, 2016: if
you need more time, this is fine, but please let us know by return
email (with a cc: to siads@siam.org). If you do not plan to submit
a revision, please let us know as well.

Thanks again for submitting your work to SIADS.

Sincerely,

Dwight Barkley
Associate Editor
