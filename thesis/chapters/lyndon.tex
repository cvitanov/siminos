Consider a $k$-symbol alphabet $\mathcal{A}$. Let
$\alpha=uv$ and $\beta=vu$, were $u$ and $v$ any word. The words $\alpha$
and $\beta$ belong to an equivalence class known as a \emph{necklace} and
represented by its
lexicographically lesser member.
For instance, for the binary alphabet consisting of letters $0$ and $1$
the words $\{0001,\, 0010,\, 0100,\, 1000\}$ form a necklace
represented by $0001$. An aperiodic necklace is called a \emph{Lyndon word}.

Lyndon words are of relevance to us because we are often
interested in listing all symbolic itineraries that correspond
to prime cycles up to length $n$. For complete $k$-ary symbolic
dynamics this is equivalent to the problem of generating all
Lyndon words of length at most $n$. As $n$ increases the
efficiency of the algorithm becomes quickly an issue. An
algorithm for generating Lyndon words has been found by
Duval\rf{Duval88} and shown to be efficient in
\refref{BerstelPocchiola94}. Efficient here means that the
running time is proportional to the number of words generated.
In \reftab{tab:duval} we provide pseudocode for Duval's
algorithm. For an explanation of the algorithm the reader is
referred to \refref{Duval88}. For efficient algorithms to
generate necklaces \cf~\refref{Cattell2000} and references
within.

Duval's algorithm for efficient generation of Lyndon words up
to length $n$. Here $\alpha$ and $\omega$ are the first and
last letters of the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ and the function
$s(x)$ returns the next letter in the alphabet for every letter
$x \neq \omega$. The auxiliary variable $\mathrm{w}$ is
considered a list of length $n$.
