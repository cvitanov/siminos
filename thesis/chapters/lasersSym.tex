\CLe\ were introduced by Gibbon and McGuinness\rf{GibMcCLE82} as a low-dimensional model
of baroclinic instability in the atmosphere.
As the name suggests they turned out to be a complex generalization
of Lorenz equations \refeq{Lorenz}:
\beq
\index{Complex Lorenz equations}
\begin{split}
 \dot{x} &=-\sigma x+ \sigma y \cont
 \dot{y} &=(\rLor-z)x-a y \cont
 \dot{z} &= \frac{1}{2}\left(x y^*+x^*y\right)-b z\,,
 \label{eq:CLe}
\end{split}
\eeq
where now $x,y$ are complex variables, $z$ is real, while the
parameters $\sigma,\,b$ are real and $\rLor=\RerCLor+i
\ImrCLor$, $a=1-i e$ are complex.
We rewrite the system in real variables
$x=x_1+ i\, x_2\,,\ y=y_1+i\, x_2$ as

Ning and Haken\rf{NingHakenCLE90} have shown
that equations isomorphic to \CLe\ also appear as a
truncation of Maxwell-Bloch equations describing a single
mode, detuned, ring laser.
%with $x,y$ and $z$
%proportional to electric field, polarization and population inversion, respectively.
They set $e+\ImrCLor=0$ so that a detuned
\eqv\ exists.
    \ES{This assumption is questionable unless it
is forced by the physics of the problem, which I cannot
follow very well. It leads to non-generic bifurcation
behavior, while one would like a model of a physical system
to be robust under perturbations (of the model). Furthermore,
the fact that the Hopf cycle in the general case is an
$\SOn{2}$-orbit has gone unnoticed. The \reqv\ can be
interpreted as an \eqv\ in a rotating frame and the measured
electric field of the laser would be the same in both cases.
    }
Bakasov and Abraham\rf{BakasovAbraham93} criticize this
choice as being ``degenerate'' and show that one can use
\CLe\ with $\ImrCLor=0$ and $e \neq 0$ to describe detuned lasers.
As we explain in \refsect{sec:Eqv0}, the choice of Ning and
Haken leads to non-generic bifurcations.

In all numerical examples
that follow, the parameters will be set to the Lorenz values
$\RerCLor=28,\, b=8/3,\, \sigma=10$, with the ``detuning'' $e=1/10$ unless explicitly
stated otherwise. Note that $e$, although related to detuning in Maxwell-Bloch equations
is not directly proportional to it\rf{BakasovAbraham93}.

\subsection{Stability of the \eqv\ at the origin}
\label{sec:Eqv0}

The origin \EQB{0} is an \eqv\ of \refeq{eq:CLeR} for any
value of the parameters. As shown in \refref{FowlerCLE82} it
is stable for $0<\RerCLor<\rho_{1c}$ and unstable for
$\rho_{1c}<\RerCLor$, where
\beq
	\rho_{1c} = 1 + \frac{(e+\ImrCLor)(e-\sigma \ImrCLor)}{(\sigma+1)^2}\,.
\eeq
At bifurcation a pair of eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis with imaginary part:
\beq
	\omega_c = \frac{\sigma (e + \ImrCLor)}{\sigma+1}\,.
	\label{eq:omegaCLE}
\eeq

Thus we can expect that after a center manifold or Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction one
can apply the equivariant Hopf bifurcation theorem\ES{state it in appropriate section,
refer to it.} with $\SOn{2}$ symmetry
and verify the existence of a \reqv\ after bifurcation\ES{I'll do this
if I have time.}. In \refref{FowlerCLE82} the authors perform a direct bifurcation analysis and
show that, for $e+\ImrCLor\neq 0$, a Hopf cycle \REQB{1} is created which also turns out to be an \SOn{2}-orbit,
\ie\ a \reqv. For $e+\ImrCLor=0$ the cycle degenerates to an \SOn{2}-orbit of \eqva,
since $\omega_c =0$, and the conditions of equivariant Hopf theorem do not apply.

The secondary bifurcation from the \reqv\ is expected according
to Krupa's theorem\rf{Krupa90} to result in
relative periodic orbits. In the non-generic case of an
\SOn{2}-orbit of \eqva, again according to
Krupa\rf{Krupa90} theorem, one gets bifurcation
to periodic orbits. A secondary bifurcation has been
studied in \refref{NingHakenCLE90}.
    \ES{
The results are messy and hard to comment on. They show
existence of supercritical and subcritical bifurcations. Will
continue this discussion later}
Since we are interested in \CLe\
precisely for its symmetry properties we will concentrate on the
case that results to generic bifurcations. Before we proceed
with this, we briefly examine the special case $e=\ImrCLor=0$.


\subsection{The $e=\ImrCLor=0$ case}

When $e=\ImrCLor=0$ we immediately observe the real subspace $x_2=y_2=0$ is flow invariant
and the usual \Le\ are recovered. From equivariance, any subspace $U_\theta$ on the $\SOn{2}$-orbit of the real
subspace is invariant as well, for example the imaginary subspace $x_1=y_1=0$. The
$U_\theta$'s are  parameterized by the angle of \SOn{2} rotations with
the restriction $\theta\in[0,\pi)$. We demonstrate the situation for the standard \Le\ parameters
in \reffig{fig:LorenzCoex}. A continuum of identical, disjoint ``Lorenz mask'' attractors exists.

respectively. The green circle is the \SOn{2}-orbit of \eqv\
$E_1$.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Yet, we cannot choose all initial conditions in one of the
flow invariant subspaces $U_\theta$. Indeed, if we use the
real subspace as reference we can choose coordinates
$(x_1,y_1,z,\theta)$ for the subspace $U$ of \Rls{5} foliated
by the $U_\theta$'s, which makes it clear that this is a
4-dimensional subspace. Points that do not lie on $U$ can be
thought of as ``mis-rotated'': we start with a point on the
real subspace and rotate by an angle $\theta$ on the
$(x_1,x_2)$-plane and by an angle $\phi\neq\theta$ on the
$(y_1,y_2)$ plane. One then would like to know where the
asymptotic dynamics for those initial conditions not in $U$
end up. Since the only \eqva\ of the equations are the origin
\EQB{0} and the group orbit of \eqv\ $\EQB{1}$, we get the hint that the
asymptotic dynamics has to be governed by the stable and
unstable manifolds of the same \eqva\ that govern dynamics in
$U$. To see whether this is true we examine the inner product
of the vector field at any point  $\ssp=(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2,z)$
with the direction of rotation of the system
% \beq
%   (x_2\ -x_1\ y_2\ -y_1)
%     \left(\barr{c}
% 	 -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1 \\
% 	 -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2 \\
% 	 (\RerCLor-z) x_1 - \ImrCLor x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \\
% 	 \ImrCLor x_1 + (\RerCLor-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\\
% 	 -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2\,.
%     \earr\right)
% \,.
% \eeq
\beq
	(\Lg \cdot \ssp) \cdot \vf(\ssp) = \left(\RerCLor-\sigma-z\right)\left(x_1 y_2 -x_2 y_1\right) -\ImrCLor\left(x_1 y_1+ x_2 y_2\right)- e\left(y_1^2+y_2^2\right)
	\label{eq:CLe0ip}
\eeq
where we have used $\Lg$, the Lie algebra generator
\PublicPrivate{}{\refeq{ZMgen}} of \SOn{2} and $\vf(a)$, the
vector field in \refeq{eq:CLeR}. We observe that for
$e=\ImrCLor=0$ only $x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1$ and $z$ appear. By
taking the time derivative of $x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1$ and using
\refeq{eq:CLeR} we can show that
\beq
	\frac{d}{dt}\left(x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1\right)= -(\sigma+1)\left(x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1\right)
\eeq
and, since $z$ is bounded, the inner product in
\refeq{eq:CLe0ip} goes to zero as
$t\rightarrow\infty$.\footnote{We cannot have $\sigma\leq
-1$.} Thus, asymptotically the vector field along any
trajectory becomes orthogonal to the direction of
infinitesimal rotations and the dynamics approach one of the
$U_\theta$'s. This is demonstrated in \reffig{fig:CLe0trans}.

\subsection{The $e\neq0,\ \ImrCLor=0$ case}
\label{sect:coordChange}

\PCedit{
In this section we turn to the ``laser case''
$e\neq0,\;\ImrCLor=0$; in the numerical examples we set the
detuning to $e=1/10$.
}
\refFig{fig:CLE} illustrates the need
to project dynamics on \reducedsp: Dynamics is organized by
the interplay of the stable and unstable manifolds of \eqv\
\EQB{0} and \reqv\ \REQB{1} but the dynamics along the
direction of rotation blur the picture and the notion of
recurrence becomes relative. We will present various
approaches to orbit space reduction in the following
sections.

To find the location of the \reqv\ it is convenient to work
on polar coordinates defined by $x=r_1 e^{i \phi_1},\,y=r_2
e^{i \phi_2}$. Equations \refeq{eq:CLe} with $\ImrCLor=0$
take the form
    %PC: Rebecca and I rederived these: they check.
\PC{
    Replaced parameter $r_i$ by $\{\ImrCLor,\ImrCLor\}$
    so the radial coordinates become $r_i$, as in the Lorentz examples.
    Replaced $\Phi$ by $\phi$ - looks prettier to me.}
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{r}_1 &=-\sigma (r_1 - r_2\cos\phi) \cont
	\dot{r}_2 &=-r_2 + r_1(\RerCLor -z)\cos\phi \cont
	\dot{z} &=  -b z+r_1 r_2\cos\phi \cont	
	\dot{\phi} &=-e-\frac{\sigma r_2 \sin\phi}{r_1}-\frac{r_1(\RerCLor-z) \sin\phi }{r_2}\,,
	\label{eq:CLePolar}
\end{split}
\eeq
where $\phi=\phi_1-\phi_2$ and the evolution equations for $\phi_1,\phi_2$ are given by
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{\phi}_1 &=-\frac{\sigma r_2 \sin\phi}{r_1}\cont
	\dot{\phi_2} &= e +\frac{r_1 (\RerCLor -z)\sin\phi}{r_2}\,.
	\label{eq:CLeAngl}
\end{split}
\eeq
The condition for a \reqv~ is that all time derivatives in \refeq{eq:CLePolar} vanish from which we get
% Explicit form here, simplified in terms of z component below
% \beq
% \begin{split}
% 	z &= -\frac{e^2}{(\sigma +1)^2}+\RerCLor -1\cont
% 	r_2 &= \frac{\sqrt{-b \left(e^2+(\sigma +1)^2\right)\left(e^2-(\RerCLor -1) (\sigma +1)^2\right)}}{(\sigma+1)^2}\cont
% 	r_1 &= \frac{\sqrt{-b \left(e^2-(\RerCLor -1) (\sigma +1)^2\right)}}{\sigma +1}\cont
% 	\Phi &= -\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sigma +1}{\sqrt{e^2+(\sigma +1)^2}}\right)
% \end{split}
% \eeq
\beq
\begin{split}
	z^{(1)} &= \frac{-e^2+(\RerCLor -1)(\sigma +1)^2}{(\sigma +1)^2}\cont
	r_1^{(1)} &= \sqrt{b z^{(1)}}\cont
	r_2^{(1)} &= \sqrt{b \left(e^2+(\sigma +1)^2\right)z^{(1)}}\cont
	\phi^{(1)} &= -\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sigma +1}{\sqrt{e^2+(\sigma +1)^2}}\right)
\end{split}
\eeq
Substituting in \refeq{eq:CLeAngl} we get $\dot{\phi}_1=\dot{\phi}_2=e \sigma/(1 + \sigma)\neq 0$ for $e\neq0$
and thus we have indeed a \reqv, not a group orbit of \eqva.

Calculation  in polar coordinates $r_1,r_2,\phi,z$ of stability eigenvalues for \REQB{1}
for the set of parameters we use here yields
\beq
	\eigRe[1]\pm i\eigIm[1]= 0.0938\pm 10.1945i,\,
    \eigExp[3]=-11.0009,\, \eigExp[4]= -13.8534\,.

The first approach we try is by use of invariant polynomials
\refeq{eq:ipLaser}, following Gilmore and
Letellier\rf{GL-Gil07b} who compute an invariant polynomials
basis for the same action of $\SOn{2}$ and use them for
symmetry reduction of a system conjugate to \CLe, with
$e=-\ImrCLor$.
\PCedit{
We use the chain rule
}%end PCedit
\[
 \dot{\overline{x}}_i=\frac{\partial \overline{x}_i}{\partial x_j}\dot{x}_j

\]
and express the result in invariant polynomials:
    \ES{mathematica notebook:CLEtransfJac.nb
    {\bf PC:} Changed $z$ to $u_5$; have not checked the algebra}
\beq
\begin{split}
\dot{u}_1 &=2\,\sigma\,(u_3-u_1)\,,\\

\dot{u}_3 &=\sigma\,  u_2-(\sigma\,  -1)\,u_3-e\,u_4+u_1\,(\rho_1-u_5)\,,\\
\dot{u}_4 &=e\, u_3-(\sigma\, +1)\,u_4\,,\\
\dot{u}_5 &=u_3-b\, u_5\,.
\end{split}
\label{eq:CLEip}
\eeq
For visualization purposes, rather than \ESedit{integrating
\refeq{eq:CLEip}, we map solutions of \refeq{eq:CLe} to the
$u_i$'s}, \reffig{fig:CLEip}. In most projections the folding
mechanism is hiden from view since the dynamics is squeezed
near the $z$-axis.

%         torn, it is continuously stretched and then folded with sharp heteroclinic
%         connection edge. {\bf ES:} Agree.}

Nevertheless we can now easily identify a suitable Poincar\'e section, guided
by the Lorenz equations example \refchap{chap:Lorenz}, as one that contains the $z$-axis and the \reqv,
here defined by the condition $u_1=u_4$. Repeating the procedure followed in \refsect{exmp:LorenzRetM}
we construct the first return map using as coordinate the Euclidean length along the intersection
of the unstable manifold of \REQB{1} with the Poincar\'e surface of section, measured from \REQB{1}, see \reffig{fig:CLEipRM}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As the next choice we explore the invariants generated by
the moving frame method.
The action \refeq{eq:SO2act} of $\SOn{2}$ on \Rls{5},
is regular on $\Rls{5}\backslash\{x_1=x_2=y_1=y_2=0\}$. Thus we can define
a {\csection} by, for instance $x_1=0,\,x_2>0$.
We can now construct a moving frame for the action
\refeq{eq:SO2act} of $\SOn{2}$ as follows. We write out
explicitly the group transformations:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
 	\overline{x}_1 &= x_1 \cos\theta - x_2 \sin\theta\label{eq:CLEexplSO2a}\cont
	\overline{x}_2 &= x_1 \sin\theta + x_2 \cos\theta\label{eq:CLEexplSO2b}\cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= y_1 \cos\theta - y_2 \sin\theta\label{eq:CLEexplSO2c}\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &= y_1 \sin\theta + y_2 \cos\theta\label{eq:CLEexplSO2d}\cont	
	\overline{z} &= z\,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Then set $\overline{x}_1=0$ and solve
\refeq{eq:CLEexplSO2a} for the group parameter to obtain the moving frame
\beq
	\theta=\tan^{-1}\frac{x_1}{x_2}
	\label{eq:CLEmf}
\eeq
which brings any point  back to the {\csection}.\footnote{Implementation note: Here it is important that $\tan^{-1}$
distinguishes quadrants on the $(x_1,x_2)$ so the transformation results to the correct geometric
interpretation.} Substituting \refeq{eq:CLEmf} in the remaining equations we get the invariants
\beq
\begin{split}
	\overline{x}_2 &= \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2} \cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= \frac{x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &=\frac{x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}\,.
	\label{eq:invLaser}
\end{split}
\eeq
\ES{The solution $\theta = 2
\tan^{-1}\frac{-x_2+\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}{x_1}$ was returned by
Mathematica. If we use $\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{x_2}{x_1}$
without taking care of the quadrant our results are
multiplied by $sgn(x_2)$.}
Note the relation to the invariant polynomials
\refeq{eq:ipLaser} and also that no syzygy is present.

On the other hand observe that the denominator is singular on
the subspace $U_S$ defined by $x_1=x_2=0$ even though the
group action is non-regular only in a subset of $U_S$, the
$z$-axis $x_1=x_2=y_1=y_2=0$. The transformations
\refeq{eq:invLaser} can thus be characterized as
non-optimal, in the sense that we have singularity in a
proper superset of $\Fix{\SOn{2}}$. The reason the
transformations fail on $U_S$ and not only on the $z$-axis
can be traced back to the way we construct them. The action
of the group can be thought of as a direct sum of irreducible
actions and the corresponding invariant (irreducible)
subspaces are the $(x_1,\,x_2)$ and $(y_1,\,y_2)$
planes.
%PC OK \ES{Not sure if planes is acceptable term here.}.
The
fact the group acts on each irreducible subspace (that is, it
leaves it invariant as a set) implies that we could define a
moving frame in any one of them independently and the
singular subspace would only depend on the points on which
the action is not regular on this irreducible subspace. By
choosing an angle in the $(x_1,\,x_2)$ irreducible subspace
as the moving frame map, the singular set is the point
$x_1=x_2=0$ in this irreducible subspace, since the group
action is not regular, or alternatively, a polar
angle is not defined at that point. Going back to the full
$5$-dimensional space the singular set of the transformations
is still given by $x_1=x_2=0$.

   }

The projections in \reffig{fig:CLEmf} reveal more about the
topology of the attractor but also present large ``jumps." Note that
the invariants \refeq{eq:invLaser} are related to the invariant polynomials \refeq{eq:ipLaser}
by division by $\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}$. This is the
reason we get a clearer visualization of the dynamics: All invariants have the same
``dimensions" as the original coordinates. At the same time division by $\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}$
causes the jumps in the $\overline{y}$ components whenever the magnitude of $x$ comes close to zero.
The fact that we do not go through $x=0$ is coincidental and specific to the problem
at hand.
% Notice that we cannot have $x=0$ for dynamics away the $z$-axis due to the syzygy \refeq{eq:syzLaser}. For, if
% $x=0$ then we would also have $y=0$ and thus we would cross the $z$-axis. This cannot happen
% since the $z$ axis is the fixed point subspace of \SOn{2} and is therefore flow-invariant.

\PublicPrivate{}{
Geometrically we can interpret the jumps in the $\overline{y}$ coordinates as follows: We
have chosen to measure angle on one of the irreducible subspaces of \SOn{2}, the $x$-plane, and project
the dynamics on orbit space by counter-rotating in both irreducible subspaces (the $x$- and $y$-plane.)
As long as a trajectory traces one lobe of the Lorenz attractor the angle varies slowly and no
problem occurs. When a trajectory changes quadrant in the $x$-plane to visit the almost opposite lobe (due to detuning
we do not visit the lobe related by rotation by $\pi$, in reality no such thing exists) we get a rapid
change in angle as the trajectory passes close to the origin. In the $y$-plane we do not necessarily change
quadrant. Call $\Delta \theta_x$ and $\Delta\theta_y$ the change in angle
in the $x$- and $y$-plane respectively, when the trajectory changes quadrant in the $x$ plane.
We always reduce to \reducedsp\ by correcting by $-\Delta\theta_x$ instead of correcting by the smallest angle\ES{I tried
implementing this directly. No luck.}.

% Since $x$ cannot vanish
The problem is mostly aesthetical in the present case,
but for \KS\ system it will be important to prevent
the denominator from vanishing.
\ES{Here I have a hunch that the denominator cannot vanish
but I can't prove it}
We observe that generic dynamics cannot enter $\Fix{\SOn{2}}$, \ie\
the $z$-axis, since {\fixedsp s} are flow invariant.
Since \SOn{2} representation in the \CLe\ example is a direct sum of irreducible representations
we cannot take more than one irreducible subspace into account
when setting up the normalization equations, at least not in a convenient way.
We can however restore democracy
between modes and extend validity of the transformations to any point where
the group acts freely, by modifying the invariants as follows:
    \PC{replaced ES version
\[\begin{split}
	\overline{x}_2 &= \frac{x_1^2+x_2^2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+y_1^2+y_2^2}} \cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= -\frac{x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+y_1^2+y_2^2}}\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &=\frac{x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+y_1^2+y_2^2}}\cont
	\overline{z} &=z\,.
\end{split}
\]
    }
\beq
\begin{split}
	\overline{x}_2 &= (x_1^2+x_2^2)/r \cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= -(x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2)/r\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &=(x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2)/r\cont

	r &= \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+y_1^2+y_2^2}
    \,.

This set of invariants lacks a geometric interpretation\ES{or does it?} but results in much cleaner phase portraits,

\subsubsection{A geometric approach}
\label{laserMFnum}

Even though the computation of invariants with the method of the moving frames is efficient,
it is still computationally prohibitive for very high dimensional flows. We will demonstrate
in the example of \CLe\ how one can use the geometric interpretation of the moving coframe method
along with the restriction of the dynamics to a \Poincare\ section to simply and effectively
perform continuous symmetry reduction in high-dimensional flows.

We have noted that \SOn{2} acts regularly and freely on $X^*=\Rls{5}\backslash\{x_1=x_2=y_1=y_2=0\}$ and
thus we are guaranteed to find the fundamental invariants by the method of moving frames
if we restrict attention to $X^*$. Nevertheless the transformations \refeq{eq:invLaser}
obtained by the moving frame method are singular in the subspace $x_1=x_2=0$\ES{Kevin
Mitchell claims that what we do here is geometrically impossible because there is
a non-removable singularity isomorphic to the magnetic monopole string singularity. In
this section I argue that we do not do it globally and this is why it is possible (and we
just do it!)}. Therefore
we would like to ensure that we apply our reduction procedure only on points away from this
subspace. A way to achieve this is by a judicious choice of \Poincare\ section in original space,
\ie~before reduction. Since we are ultimately interested in reducing the dynamics to a \Poincare\
return map this is enough for our purposes. Of course locating a \Poincare\ section is a non-trivial
task but as we will see in the following, for the procedure to work we will
have to reduce the candidate \Poincare\ sections to those that are invariant (as a set) under
the group action. Furthermore we already have gained the insight from the simpler \Le\ problem
that a good choice of section is one that passes through the \eqva\ that organize the flow.
Here we are naturally led to choose a section that passes through the \reqv~\REQB{1} such as the
section $\mathcal{P}$ defined by $\overline{x}_2-\overline{y}_2=0$ in the variables of
\refeq{eq:invLaser} or by $x_1^2+x_2^2-(x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2)=0$ in original space and
a suitable orientation condition so that trajectories intersect the section away from
$x_1=x_2=0$ subspace. Here the orientation condition has be chosen so that trajectories intersect
$\mathcal{P}$ moving from the ``outside'' of the section in \reffig{fig:CLEmartini} to the
``inside''.
Since $\mathcal{P}$ has been defined by a condition in invariant variables \refeq{eq:invLaser}
it turns out to be $\SOn{2}$-invariant in the full space. Therefore the group orbit of any point on
$\mathcal{P}$ lies on $\mathcal{P}$. In \reffig{fig:CLEmartini} the group orbits of the points
of intersection of \rpo~``01'' have been visualized as circles on $\mathcal{P}$.

The next step is to choose a representative out of each group orbit by means of a section\ES{There appears to be
technical meaning to the word section here.} $\mathcal{K}$ that intersects each group orbit
exactly once. The existence of a section is guaranteed since a {\csection} as in \refPro{pro:crossExists} exists,
this was the whole point of restricting the problem to a Poincar\'e section
on which the group \emph{acts} freely. Here we choose $x_1=0$ for $\mathcal{K}$. Geometrically
this is equivalent to rotating each point of intersection on $\mathcal{K}$ by
an appropriate angle so that it lies on $\mathcal{K}$, exactly as prescribed by
the moving frame \refeq{eq:CLEmf}. This rotation, a linear operation for any given point,
can be applied efficiently even in high dimensional space when the rotation group representation is a direct
sum of irreducible representations, as is frequently the case with truncations of PDEs.
Of course, the transformation is still non-linear through the dependence on the angle and equivalent
to the explicit transformations \refeq{eq:invLaser}.

Implementing symmetry reduction in any of the above ways, the reward is the same: The
dynamics are reduced to a return map to the Poincar\'e section, which due to
the very strong contraction is approximately $1$-dimensional. The dynamics on the Poincar\'e
section are parametrized by the Euclidean distance of points along the unstable manifold, as we did
for the Lorenz example.
The return map is unimodal and allows for systematic determination of all cycles of
a given length. Here we were able to determine all cycles up to length $7$, using
the return map of \reffig{fig:CLEinvRM} to generate guesses, and the multiple-shooting
algorithm of \refsect{sec:symShoot} to refine them to machine accuracy.

\subsection{Stability of \reqva}
\label{sect:StabEq}

\ESedit{
In the moving frame method the reduced \statesp\ is
identified (at least locally) with the {\csection}
$\mathcal{K}$. This provides a means of calculating stability
of \reqva in reduced \statesp. Assume that, as was the case
for \CLe, the {\csection} is orthogonal to the group action
for any $x$ on $\mathcal{K}$. We observe that for the point
$x_o$ on \reqv\ \REQB{1} that lies on the {\csection}
$\mathcal{K}$ we can decompose $\vf(x)$ in \refeq{eq:difeq}
in a part $\vf_\shortparallel$ parallel to the group action
and a part $\vf_\perp$ on the {\csection}, as in
\refeq{flowSplit}. To compute stability eigenvalues of \reqv\
we only need to consider the linearization of $\vf_\perp$
which is identified with $\vf$ in reduced space. It is
convenient to introduce the projection operator
\refeq{transvProj} that projects a vector to the {\csection}.
The {\stabmat} $M_{ij}$ is then given by
    \PC{Here the projection operator \refeq{transvProj} is OK,
    as the action of the group on $\ssp_{\REQB{1}}$ is trivial?
    Not sure...
    }
    \PC{do not like that we changed notation
    \refeq{stabMat} from $\Mvar$ to $M$ -
    should use the same notation for all reduced \statesp\ quantities,
    for example $\hat{\Mvar}$.
    }
 \beq
	M_{ij} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(\PperpOp \cdot  \vf)_i
		= \Pperp_{ik}\frac{\partial  \vf_k}{\partial x_j}
          +\frac{\partial \Pperp_{ik}}{\partial x_j} \vf_k
		\label{eq:stabreqvdef}
 \eeq
Now
\beq
	\Pperp_{ik}	= \delta_{ik}-\frac{(\Lg \cdot x)_i(\Lg \cdot x)_k}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}
			= \delta_{ik}-\frac{\Lg_{im} x_m \Lg_{k\ell} x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}
\eeq
and
\bea
	\frac{\partial \Pperp_{in}}{\partial x_j}  &=&  -\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(\frac{\Lg_{iq} \cdot x_q \Lg_{n\ell} \cdot x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\right)\continue
			&=& -\left(\frac{\Lg_{iq}\delta_{jq} \Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}+\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{n\ell}\delta_{j\ell}}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}-\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^4}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(\Lg \cdot x)^2 \right)\continue
			&=& -\left(\frac{\Lg_{ij} \Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}+\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{nj}}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}-2\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{n\ell} x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^4}\Lg_{mj}\Lg_{mp}x_p \right)\continue
% 			&=& -\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\left(\Lg_{ij}\Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell+\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{nj}-2\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{n\ell} x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\Lg_{mj}\Lg_{mp}x_p \right)\continue
			&=& -\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\left(\Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell\left(\Lg_{ij}-\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q }{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\Lg_{mj}\Lg_{mp}x_p\right)+\Lg_{iq}x_q\left( \Lg_{nj}-\frac{ \Lg_{n\ell} x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\Lg_{mj}\Lg_{mp}x_p\right) \right)\continue
			&=& -\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\left(\Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell\left(\delta_{im}-\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q }{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\Lg_{mp}x_p\right)\Lg_{mj}+\Lg_{iq}x_q\left( \delta_{nm}-\frac{ \Lg_{n\ell} x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\Lg_{mp}x_p\right)\Lg_{mj} \right)\continue
			&=& -\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\left(\Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell \Pperp_{im} \Lg_{mj}+\Lg_{iq}x_q \Pperp_{nm} \Lg_{mj} \right)\continue
\eea

Therefore \refeq{eq:stabreqvdef} takes the form
\beq
	M_{ij}=\Pperp_{in}\frac{\partial  \vf_n}{\partial x_j}-\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\left(\Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell \Pperp_{im} \Lg_{mj}+\Lg_{iq}x_q \Pperp_{nm} \Lg_{mj} \right)\vf_n
\eeq
or in matrix form
\beq
	\mathbf{M}=\PperpOp \mathbf{A}-\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot  x)^2}\left( \left[\vf \cdot \left(\Lg \cdot x\right)\right] \left(\PperpOp \Lg\right) +\left(\Lg \cdot x\right) \otimes \left[\vf \cdot \left( \PperpOp \Lg\right)\right] \right)
	\label{eq:reqvStab}
\eeq
where $A_{ij}=\frac{\partial \vf_i}{\partial x_j}$. This
expression allows to calculate stability of \reqva\ working
in the equivariant variables, without explicit knowledge of
the form the differential assumes in reduced space. Applying
\refeq{eq:reqvStab} for \reqv\ \REQB{1} of \CLe\ we obtain
the same eigenvalues \refeq{eq:CLeREQBstab} we computed in
polar coordinates along with a zero eigenvalue due to the
fact that we still work in the equivariant variables.

\subsection{Wrong: Stability of \reqva}
\label{sect:StabEqWrong}

In the moving frame method the reduced \statesp\ is identified (at least locally) with
the {\csection} $\mathcal{K}$. This provides a means of calculating stability of \reqva in
reduced \statesp. Assume that, as was the case for \CLe, the {\csection} is orthogonal
to the group action for any $x$ on $\mathcal{K}$. We observe that for the point $x_o$ on \reqv\ \REQB{1} that lies on the {\csection} $\mathcal{K}$ we can decompose $\vf(x)$ in \refeq{eq:difeq} in a part $\vf_\shortparallel$ parallel to the group action and a part $\vf_\perp$ on the {\csection}
\beq
	\vf(x_o)=\vf_\shortparallel(x_o)+\vf_\perp(x_o)\,.
\eeq
One can always write $\vf_\shortparallel(x_o)=c\Lg \cdot x$ where $c$ a constant.
    \ES{
I believe that the following is wrong because $c$ will in general
depend on the point on the {\csection} and thus when we consider
variations we have to take this fact into account, yet I write it
down since it is what we use for stability of \reqva\ in KS paper.
Chossat and Lauterbach\rf{ChossLaut00} seem to take this into
account but I don't know how to use their expressions in practice. The subsection
with the same title as this one, I argue, is the correct way to do it, and
also most straightforward.
    }
Then
\beq
	A_{ij}=\left.\frac{\partial\vf_i}{\partial x_j}\right|_{x_o}=c\Lg+\left.\frac{(\partial\vf_\perp)_i}{\partial x_j}\right|_{x_o}\,.
\eeq
Since hyperbolicity of a \reqv\ is determined by the dynamics on the {\csection} (see \rf{Krupa90})
we identify
\beq
	\left.\frac{(\partial\vf_\perp)_i}{\partial x_j}\right|_{x_o}=\left.\frac{\partial\vf_i}{\partial x_j}\right|_{x_o}-c\Lg
\eeq
as the fundamental matrix which we are able to compute without explicitly computing the dynamics on
the {\csection}.

\subsection{Integration on the {\slice}}
\label{sec:IntSliceI}

If we replace our differential equations \refeq{eq:difeq} with the system
\beq
	\frac{dx}{dt}=\PperpOp v(x)\,,
	\label{eq:difeqTransv}
\eeq
solutions will stay on the {\slice} $\mathcal{K}$ for any initial condition on $\mathcal{K}$
as there is no component of $\PperpOp v(x)$ in the direction of the continuous symmetry.

For \CLe\ a trajectory of \refeq{eq:difeqTransv} on the
unstable manifold of \REQB{1} is shown in
\reffig{fig:CLEtransv}. Our claim that the trajectory will
stay on the {\slice} is not verified by this figure,
even though this could be attributed to numerical issues.
    \PC{ I would guess there is bug here - there is too much
    of a drift to be accumulation of numerical errors -
    direction is marginal, so one expects errors to induce a
    diffusive random walk, spreading with $t^{1/2}$, \ie,
    very slowly. It's better than \reffig{fig:CLE}, but not
    by much. How by starting both full \statesp\ and
    {\slice} integrations at the same point, and
    tracking the distance $(\ssp(t)-\ssp^\perp(t))^2$ of the
    two trajectories in the \reffig{fig:CLEinv} projection -
    if they diverge exponentially, we need to figure out what
    is wrong with the {\slice} integration. }

distance does not grow exponentially indicating that
numerical solution of \refeq{eq:difeqTransv} is accurate.
