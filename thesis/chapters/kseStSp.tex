We now turn to exploring Hopf's vision
numerically, on a specific \KS\ system of size  $L=22$.
For this system size
% The size of this
% small system is $\sim 2.5$ mean wavelengths
% ($\tildeL/\sqrt{2}= 2.4758\ldots$),
% and
the competition between states with wavenumbers 2 and 3
leads to the empirically observed `sustained turbulence.'
A typical long orbit is shown in \refFig{f:ks_L22}.
\PublicPrivate{}{
Asymptotic attractor structure of small systems like
the one studied here
is very sensitive to system parameter variations, and,
as is true of
any realistic unsteady flow, there is no rigorous way of
establishing that this `turbulence' is sustained for all time,
rather than being
merely a very long transient on a way to an
attracting periodic state.
For large system size
    \PC{where is ``
, as the one shown in \reffig{f:ks_largeL}, it is ''
    }
hard to imagine a scenario under which attractive periodic states
(as shown in \refref{FSTks86}, they do exist) would have significantly
large immediate basins of attraction.
Regardless of the
(non)existence of a $t \to \infty$ chaotic attractor, study
of the invariant unstable solutions and the associated Smale
horseshoe structures in system's \statesp\ offers valuable
insights into the observed unstable `coherent structures.'
}%end \PublicPrivate

Because of the strong $k^4$ contraction, for a small system size
one expects that the long-time dynamics is confined to low-dimensional
inertial manifold. Indeed, numerically the leading Lyapunov exponents of the
$L=22$ chaotic attractor are
\[
	(\Lyap_i) = (0.048, 0, 0, -0.003, -0.189, -0.256, -0.290, \cdots)\,,
\]
so the chaotic dynamics mostly takes
place close to a 4-dimensional manifold, with strong
contraction in other dimensions.  The two zero exponents
are due to the
time\rf{HakenZeroLyap83} and space translational symmetries of the \KSe,
and it was shown in \refrefs{Christiansen97,lanCvit07}
that within particular curvilinear coordinate frames, the
dynamics on the attractor can sometimes be reduced to
local 1- or 2-dimensional maps.
Hence a relatively small
number of Fourier modes, typically 128 used in numerical calculations presented here,
suffices to obtain
numerically accurate (within $10^{-5}$) invariant
solutions.

We next investigate the properties of \eqva\ and \reqva\ and determine numerically
a large set of the short periods \rpo s for KS in a periodic cell of
size $L=22$.

\subsection{\Eqva\ and \reqva}

In addition to the trivial \eqv\ $u=0$ (denoted \EQV{0}),
we find three \eqva\ with dominant wavenumber $k$
(denoted \EQV{k}) for $k = 1, 2, 3$.  All {\eqva}, shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:KS22Equil}, are symmetric with respect to the reflection
symmetry \refeq{KSparity}.
In addition, \EQV{2} and \EQV{3} are symmetric with respect
to translation \refeq{KSshift}, by $L/2$ and $L/3$, respectively.
\EQV{2} and \EQV{3} essentially lie, respectively, in
the 2$^\mathrm{nd}$ and 3$^\mathrm{rd}$ Fourier component complex plane,
with small $k=2j$, $k=3j$ harmonics deformations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The stability of the {\eqva} is characterized by the eigenvalues
$\eigExp[j]$ of the \stabmat.  The leading 10 eigenvalues for each
\eqv\ are listed in \reftab{tab:Eksym}. We have computed (available upon request)
the corresponding eigenvectors as well. As an \eqv\ with $\mathrm{Re}\,
\lambda_j > 0$ is unstable in the direction of the corresponding
eigenvector $\jEigvecKS{j}$, the eigenvectors provide flow-intrinsic
(PDE discretization independent) coordinates which we use for visualization
of unstable manifolds and homo/heteroclinic connections between
\eqva.

The eigenvalues of \EQV{0} are determined by the linear part of the KS
equation \refeq{expan}: $\lambda_k=(k/\tilde{L})^2-(k/\tilde{L})^4$.
For $L=22$, there are three pairs of unstable eigenvalues, corresponding,
in decreasing order, to three unstable modes $k=2,3$, and 1.  For each
mode, the corresponding eigenvectors lie in the plane spanned by
$\Re \, a_k$ and $\Im \, a_k$. \refTab{tab:Eksym}
lists the symmetries of the eigenvectors of
\eqva\ \EQV{1} to \EQV{3}.

Consistent with the bifurcation diagram of \reffig{fig:ksBifDiag},
we find two pairs of \reqva\ \refeq{reqva} with velocities
$c =\pm 0.73699$ and $\pm 0.34954$
which we label \REQV{\pm}{1} and \REQV{\pm}{2},
for `traveling waves.'
The profiles of the two \reqva\ and their time evolution
with eventual decay into the chaotic attractor are
shown in \reffig{f:ks22TW}.  The leading eigenvalues of
\REQV{\pm}{1} and \REQV{\pm}{2} are listed in \reftab{tab:Eksym};
those with $\eigRe > -2.5$ are also plotted in

\refTab{tab:L22cminus} lists \eqv\ energy $E$,
the local Poincar\'e section return time $T$,
radially expanding Floquet multiplier $\ExpaEig_e$, and
the least contracting Floquet multiplier $\ExpaEig_c$
for all $L=22$ \eqva\ and \reqva.
The return time $T=2\pi/\eigIm[e]$ is given by the imaginary
part of the leading complex eigenvalue of a given
\eqv\ or \reqv,
the expansion
multiplier per one turn of the most unstable spiral-out by
$\ExpaEig_e\approx\exp(\eigRe[e] T)$, and the contraction
rate along the slowest contracting stable eigendirection by
$\ExpaEig_c\approx\exp(\eigRe[c]T)$. We learn that the shortest
`turn-over' time is $\approx 10-20$, and that if there exist
horseshoe sets of unstable \po s associated with
these \eqva,  they have unstable
multipliers of order of $\ExpaEig_e \sim 5-10$, and that
they are surprisingly thin in the folding direction, with
contracting multipliers of order of $10^{-2}$,

As shown in \refTab{tab:Eksym},
the \EQV{1} \eqv\ has two unstable
planes within which the solutions are spiralling out (\ie, two
pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues).  The \EQV{2} has one such plane,
while the \EQV{3} has two real positive degenerate eigenvalues, so the solutions are
moving radially away from the \eqv\ within the plane spanned
by the corresponding eigenvectors.  \PublicPrivate{}{Since \EQV{1} has
a larger unstable subspace, it is expected to have much less influence on the
long time dynamics compared to \EQV{2} and \EQV{3}.

$\eigExp = \eigRe \pm i\eigIm$,

\beq
  a(0) = a_{{\EQV{k}}} + \epsilon\,\exp(\delta)\jEigvecKS{j}
\,,
\ee{linUnstMan}
where $\delta$ takes the set of values uniformly distributed in the

remarkably different: as can be seen in \reffig{f:KS22E1man2},
almost all orbits within the manifold converge to the \eqv\ \EQV{2}.  The

The two-dimensional unstable manifold of \EQV{2} is shown in
\reffig{f:KS22E2man}.  All orbits within the manifold converge
to \EQV{2} shifted by $L/4$.  So this manifold can be viewed as a homoclinic
connection.  It also contains a pair of heteroclinic connections from
\EQV{2} to \EQV{3}.

The \eqv\ \EQV{3} has a pair of real unstable eigenvalues
equal to each other.  Therefore, within the plane spanned by the
corresponding eigenvectors, the orbits move radially away from
the \eqv.  In order to trace out the unstable manifold,
we start with a set of initial conditions within the unstable plane
\beq
 a(0) = a_{{\EQV{3}}} + \epsilon(v_1 \cos \phi + v_2 \sin \phi)\,,
  \quad\phi\in[0,2\pi]\,,
\label{unsManSeed}
\eeq
where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are orthonormal vectors within the
plane spanned by the two unstable eigenvectors, seeded as in
\refeq{linUnstMan}.
  The unstable manifold
of \EQV{3} is shown in \reffig{f:KS22E3man}.  The 3-fold symmetry of
the manifold is related to the symmetry of \EQV{3} with respect to
translation by $L/3$.  The manifold contains heteroclinic orbits
connecting \EQV{3} to three different points of the circle of {\eqva}
\EQV{2} translated set of solutions. Note also that the segments of orbits $B$ and $C$
between \EQV{3} and \EQV{2} in \reffigs{f:KS22E1man2}{f:KS22E2man}

An understanding of the ubiquity of heteroclinic connections in KSe, as
opposed to their non-genericity in a general high-dimensional system, is provided in \refref{KNSks90}.
For our system size
there are exactly two representatives
of the $\EQV{2}$ family that lie in the intersection of $\bbUplus$ and $\bbUone$ related
to each other by an $L/4$ shift. Denote them by $\EQV{2}$ and $\Shift_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ respectively. The unstable eigenplane of
$\EQV{2}$ lies on $\bbUplus$ while that of $\Shift_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ lies on $\bbUone$, \cf\ \reftab{tab:Eksym}.
The $\EQV{3}$ family members that live in $\bbUplus$ have one of their unstable eigenvectors (the one related to the heteroclinic
connection to $\EQV{2}$ family)  on $\bbUplus$, while the other does not lie on the symmetry-invariant subspace.
Similarly, for the $\EQV{1}$ family we observe that the \eqva\ in $\bbUplus$ have
an unstable plane on $\bbUplus$ (again related to the heteroclinic connection) and a second one with no symmetry.
Thus $\Shift_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ appears as a sink on $\bbUplus$, while all other \eqva\ appear as sources.
This explains the heteroclinic connections from $\EQV{1}\,,\EQV{2}$ and $\EQV{3}$ to $\Shift_{1/4}\EQV{2}$.
By equivariance the dynamics within $\Shift_{1/4} \bbUplus$ must look the same and taking into account \reftab{tab:Eksym} we understand that within $\bbUone$
we have connections from $\Shift_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ (and members of $\EQV{1}$ and $\EQV{3}$ families) to $\EQV{2}$ and the
formation of a heteroclinic loop. Due to the translational invariance of KS there is a heteroclinic loop for any two points
of the $\EQV{2}$ family related by an $L/4$-shift.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to illustrate the relative influence of \eqva\ and \reqva\ on the dynamics
within the KS chaotic attractor for $L = 22$, we calculated the distance of a
typical orbit, shown in \refFig{f:ks_L22}, to different \eqva\ and \reqva .
Of course, since the definition of 'distance' can be chosen in many different ways, such
analysis has only qualitative value.

The distance of a state-space point $a$ to \eqv\ $a_{\EQV{k}}$ is measured as a
Euclidean distance in Fourier space minimized with respect to the translation
of the \eqv\ by $\Shift_{\shift/L}$:
\beq
   d_{\EQV{k}} = \min_\shift \|a - \Shift_{\shift/L} a_{\EQV{k}} \|\,,\quad k = 1,2,3.
\ee{eq:proxeq}
Similarly, the distance to \reqv\ $a_{\REQV{\pm}{k}}$ is defined as follows
\beq
  d_{\REQV{k}{}} = \min_{\shift} \|a - \Shift_{\shift/L} a_{\REQV{\pm}{k}} \|\,,\quad k = 1,2,
\ee{eq:proxtw}
where we consider the distance to both $a_{\REQV{-}{k}}$ and $a_{\REQV{+}{k}}$, thus
minimizing both with respect to translation $\Shift_{\shift/L}$ and reflection $\Refl$.

The plot of $d_{\EQV{k}}$ in \refFig{f:ks_prox_eq}(b) show that \EQV{2} has a dominant
influence on the dynamics, \EQV{3} is influencing the dynamics more intermittently, while
\EQV{1} has little effect on the dynamics.  Similarly, as shown in \refFig{f:ks_prox_eq}(c),
the chaotic orbit does not visit the neighborhoods of \reqva , so their influence on
the chaotic dynamics is also minimal.
    \ES{After plotting unstable manifold of \REQV{\pm}{1}
in \reffig{fig:SO2inv} I don't anymore agree with this argument.}

\subsection{\Rpo s}
\label{sec:rpos}

The \rpo s satisfy the condition \refeq{KSrpos1}
$u(x+\shift_p,\period{p}) = u(x,0)$,
where $\period{p}$ is the period and $\shift_p$ the phase shift.
We have limited our search to orbits with $\period{p} < 200$ and found
over 300 \rpo s with $\shift_p > 0$.
Each \rpo\ with phase shift
$\shift_p \neq 0$ has a reflection symmetric partner
$u_p(x) \to -u_p(-x)$ with phase shift $-\shift_p$.

The search has not been exhaustive, and there are likely to be more
orbits with $\period{p} < 200$. However, the orbits we have found provide a representative sample of
typical periodic and \rpo s and approximate well the chaotic
attractor (since they were located using seeds obtained from close
returns within the chaotic dynamics).

The horizontal line at $0.048$
indicates the numerical value  of the largest
Lyapunov exponent of the chaotic attractor.
} \label{f:ks22rposT}
\end{figure}

\refFig{f:ks22rposT}\,(\textit{a}) shows the \rpo s in the plane
$(\period{},\shift)$.  Not much is learned from such plot other than
that for longer periods the \rpo s are scattered over the
whole $(\period{},\shift)$ plane.

The stability of the orbits is determined by their Floquet exponents,
defined as
\beq
    s_j = \eigRe[j]/\period{p} \,,
\ee{FloqExp}
where $\ExpaEig_j = e^{\eigRe[j] \pm i \eigIm[j]}$ are the
eigenvalues of the fundamental matrix $\mathbf{g}(\shift_p)J(a_p,\period{p})$
(see sec~\ref{sec:symShoot}).

As was already the case for the Lyapunov exponents
discussed in \refSect{sec:L22}, for all
periodic and \rpo s we have found, only four Floquet
exponents are dynamically relevant, with the remaining ones indicating
strong contraction towards the 4-dimensional manifold containing the chaotic attractor.
Out of the four leading exponents, two equal zero, due to
the time and space translational invariance of the orbits.  Of the
remaining two, one is always positive, while the second one is
either positive or negative.

The scatter of the largest Floquet exponents
of periodic and \rpo s is shown in \reffig{f:ks22rposT}\,(\textit{b}).
In this case some tendency of accumulation toward the largest
Floquet exponent 0.048 of the chaotic attractor
can be noted.  This, however, is in part an artifact of initializing
the \rpo\ searches by near recurrences in long-time \statesp\
trajectories.

The small period \rpo s outline the coarse structure of the chaotic
attractor, while the longer period \rpo s resolve the finer details
of the dynamics.
The first four orbits with the shortest periods we have found are
shown in \reffig{f:ks22rpos}(\textit{a-d}).  The shortest \rpo\ with
$\period{p} = 16.4$ is also the most unstable, with one positive
Floquet exponent equal 0.328.  The other short orbits are less
unstable, with the largest Floquet exponent
in the range
0.018 -- 0.073, typical of the long time attractor average.

We have found \rpo s which stay close to the unstable
manifold of \EQV{2}. As is illustrated in
\reffig{f:ks22rpos}(\textit{e-h}), all such orbits have shift
$\shift_p \approx L/4$, similar to the shift of orbits within
the unstable manifold of \EQV{2}, which start at \EQV{2} and
converge to $\Shift_{1/4}$\EQV{2} (see \reffig{f:KS22E2man}).
This \PCedit{observation suggests} that the `cage' of
unstable manifolds of \eqva\ plays an important role in
organizing the chaotic dynamics of the \KS\ equation. Yet
they do not tell the whole story. As we will see in
\refchap{chap:kseRedStSp} the unstable manifolds of the
\reqva\ play an important role as well.


\subsection{Pre-periodic orbits} \label{ssec:po}

As discussed in \refSect{sec:KSePO}, a \rpo\ will be periodic, \ie,
$\shift_p = 0$, if it either {\bf (a)} lives within the $\bbUplus$ antisymmetric
subspace, $-u(-x,0) = u(x,0)$, or {\bf (b)}
returns to its reflection
after a period: $u(x,\period{p})=-u(-x,0)$,
and is thus periodic
with period $2\period{p}$.
The dynamics of
\KS\ system in the antisymmetric subspace and \po s with symmetry {\bf (a)} have
been investigated
previously\rf{Christiansen97,LanThesis,lanCvit07}. The KS equation
with $L = 22$ does not have any periodic orbits of this type.

As discussed in \refSect{sec:KSePO} the only periodic
orbits that we found for the system have isotropy subgroup $\Dn{1}$.
We have found over 50
pre-periodic orbits with $\period{p} < 100$
which possess the symmetry
of type {\bf (b)}. Some of the shortest such orbits we have found are shown in
\reffig{f:ks22rpos}(\textit{i-l}).
Several were found as
repeats of pre-periodic orbits during searches
for \rpo s with non-zero shifts,
while most have been
found as solutions of the pre-periodic orbit
condition \refeq{KSpos} with reflection,
which takes form
\beq
 -\mathbf{g}(-\shift)a^\ast(\period{p}) = a(0)\,.
\label{KSposFour}
\eeq
in the Fourier space representation
(compare it to the condition \refeq{eq:system} for \rpo s).

In \reffig{f:drivedrag} we plot \refeq{EnRate}, the time-dependent
$\dot{\expctE}$ in the power input $P$ {\em vs.}
dissipation rate $D$ plane, for $L=22$ \eqva\ and \reqva,
a selected \rpo, and for a typical `turbulent' long-time
trajectory.

Projections from the $\infty$-dimensional \statesp\ onto the 3-dimensional
$(E,P,D)$ representation of the flow, such as
\reffigs{f:drivedrag}{f:drivedragConn}, can be misleading.
The most one can say is that if points are clearly separated in an
$(E,P,D)$ plot (for example, in \reffig{f:drivedrag}
$\EQV{1}$ \eqv\ is outside the recurrent set), they are also separated
in the full \statesp.  Converse is not true -- states of
very different topology can have similar energies.

An example is
the \rpo\ $(\period{p},\shift_p) = (32.8,10.96)$
(see \reffig{f:ks22rpos}(\textit{b})) which appears well embedded
within the turbulent flow. The mean power $\timeAver{P_p}$ evaluated
as in \refeq{poE}, see \reffig{f:drivedrag},
is numerically quite close to the long-time
turbulent time average $\timeAver{P}$.
Similarly close prediction of mean dissipation rate in the
\pCf\ from a single-period \po\ computed by
Kawahara and Kida\rf{KawKida01} has lead to
optimistic hopes that `turbulence' is different from
low-dimensional chaos, insofar that the determination of one special
\po\ could yield all long-time averages.
Regrettably, not true -- as always, here too one needs a hierarchy
of \po s of increasing length to obtain accurate
predictions\rf{DasBuch}.

For any given \rpo\ a convenient visualization is
offered by the {\em mean velocity frame}, {\ie},
a reference frame that rotates with velocity
$v_p=\shift_p/\period{p}$.
In the mean velocity frame a \rpo\ becomes
a \po, as in \reffig{f:MeanVelocityFrame}\,(\textit{b}).
However, each {\rpo} has its own mean velocity frame and thus
sets of \rpo s are difficult to visualize simultaneously.
