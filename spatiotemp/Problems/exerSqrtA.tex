Consider matrix
\[
A=
\MatrixII{4}{10}
         {0}{9}
\,.
\]
Generalize the square root function $f(x)=x^{1/2}$ to
a square root  $f(A)=A^{1/2}$ of a matrix $A$.
\\
a) Which one(s) of these is/are the square root of $A$
\[
\MatrixII{2}{2}
         {0}{3}
\;,
\MatrixII{-2}{10}
         {0}{3}
\;,
\MatrixII{-2}{-2}
         {0}{-3}
\;,
\MatrixII{2}{-10}
         {0}{-3}
\;\,?
\]
b) Assume that the eigenvalues of a [$d\times{d}$] matrix are all
   distinct. How many square root matrices does such matrix have?
   \\
c) Given a [2$\times$2] matrix $A$ with a distinct pair of eigenvalues
   $\{\lambda_1,\lambda_2\}$, write down a formula that generates
   all square root matrices $A^{1/2}$. Hint: one can do this
   using the 2 projection operators associated with the matrix $A$.
