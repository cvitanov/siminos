Tentative title:    ``Is there anything cats cannot do?"

\begin{description}

\item[2016-11-18 Predrag]
A theory of turbulence that has done away with \emph{dynamics}?
We rest our case.

As a gentle introduction
for a reader too busy\rf{focusPOT} to study the book\rf{ChaosBook},
we
disguise a brief course on chaos theory as something everyone
understands, a Bernoulli coin toss, \refsect{s:coinToss}.

one determines the total number of
{\lattstate}s by computing the {\HillDet} \refeq{detBern0} of the
\emph{\jacobianOrb}

The observation that a Bernoulli system can be viewed as a discretization
of a first-order in time ODE, eq.~\refeq{1stepVecEq}, with solutions
whose temporal global linear stability is described by the {\jacobianOrb}
$\jMorb_{\zeit\zeit'}=\delta{F[\Xx]}_{\zeit}/\delta\ssp_{\zeit'}$, has
profound implications for dissipative \spt\ systems such as Navier-Stokes
and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\rf{GuBuCv17}.

As we shall here have to traverse territory unfamiliar to many, we
follow Mephistopheles pedagogical dictum ``You have to say it three
times"\rf{GoetheIstuZim1806}, and sing our song thrice.

The deep insight here is that the two formulations of mechanics, the
for\-ward-in-time Hamiltonian evolution, and the global, Lagrangian,
{\templatt} formulation are related by the {\em Hill's formula}.

The deep insight
here is the realization that the {\em\HillDet}, \ie, the volume of the
{\em\jacobianOrb} (\reffig{fig:BernCyc2Jacob} and \ref{fig:catCycJacob})
partitions system's \statesp.

Next, we address two questions:
(i) how is the high-dimensional orbit \jacobianOrb\ $\jMorb$ related
to the temporal [$d\!\times\!d$] \jacobianM\ $\jMat$?
(\refsect{s:LC21Hill}),
and
(ii) how does one evaluate the orbit \jacobianM\ $\jMorb$?
(\refsects{sect:LC21recip1d}{sect:LC21recip1d}).

The theory is compactly summarized by its {\tzeta} \refeq{Isola90-13}
that counts Bravais lattices.

Still, when we think of a temporal lattice as `time': no dynamicist does
that. Embarrassing.

The dynamics is breathtakingly simple on the reciprocal lattice.
Spatial period-$\cl{}$
Bravais cell maps onto a regular $\cl{}$-gon in the reciprocal lattice. Time reversal fixes
the symmetric solutions to sit on the symmetry
axes, the boundaries of the fundamental domain.
Lattice shift $\shift_j$ maps out the $\Group$-orbit by running on
circles, and orbits visit the $1/2\cl{}$ wedge only once, so the points
in the fundamental domain represent an orbit each.

with all reciprocal
lattice Brillioun zone solutions {\orbit}s in an $1/n$ sliver of a
$\cl{}$-gon.

No self-respecting crystallographer would be drawing longer and longer
Bravais {\lattstate}s \refeq{reflSymOdd}-\refeq{reflSymEvens1} - they
eventually run off the sheet of paper, no matter how wide.
A professional crystallographer plots all {\lattstate}s snugly together
in the first Brillouin zone, where the translational orbit of a
{\lattstate} is -literally- a circle, symmetric  {\lattstate}s sit on
boundaries of point group's fundamental domain, and everything is
maximally diagonalized in term's of space group \Group\ irreps.

Consider
\[
\rho_{\vec{G}}(\vec{x})= e^{i\vec{G}\cdot\vec{r}(\vec{x})}
\,,
\]
where $\vec{G}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector. By definition,
$\vec{G}\cdot\vec{a}$ is an integer multiple of $2\pi$, $\rho_{\vec{G}}=1$ for
lattice vectors.
For any other state, reciprocal {\lattstate} is given by
\[
e^{i\vec{G}\cdot\vec{u}(\vec{x})} \neq 1
\,.
\]

When a
cube is a building block that tiles a $3D$ cubic lattice, it is referred
to as the `elementary' or `Wigner-Seitz' cell, and its Fourier transform
is called `the first Brillouin zone' in `the reciprocal space'.

moves them in opposite directions.

The eigenvectors of the translation operator which satisfy the
periodicity of the Bravais lattice % \refeq{2DBravLatt}
are plane waves of form:
\beq
f_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{z}) = e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{z}}
  \,, \quad
\mathbf{k} \in \overline{\lattice}
\,,
\ee{LC21:Rcpr1dEgnVect}
where the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ is on the reciprocal lattice
$\overline{\lattice}$.

 A general plane wave does not
satisfy the periodicity, unless
\beq
e^{i {k} \cdot {R}} = 1
\, .
\ee{LC21:PrdicPlaneWave}
Since ${R}$ is a vector from the Bravais lattice $\lattice$, the wave
vector $\mathbf{k}$ must lie in the reciprocal lattice of $\lattice$:
\beq
\mathbf{k} \in \lattice^*
\,,\quad
\lattice^* =
\left\{ m \mathbf{b}\,|\,m \in \mathbb{Z}\right\} \, ,
\ee{LC21:RcprocalLattice}
where the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors $\mathbf{b}$ satisfies:
 \beq
\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 2 \pi
\, .

% \subsection
{\bf Reciprocal {\lattstate}}

An infinite {\lattstate} is periodic if the state is invariant under the action of a translation group.
A translation group can be described by a Bravais lattice, the vector in
which determines the direction and distance of the translation. When the dynamical system
has time translation symmetry, the defining equation of the system is invariant under translations.
So it is natural to use the eigenvectors of the translation operator to study the {\lattstate}s of the
system.

The eigenvectors of translation operators are plane waves defined on the lattice. But to study
the {\lattstate}s, we need to require that the plane wave also satisfies the periodic
condition. Generally, a $d$\dmn\ Bravais lattice can be described by:
\bea
{\lattice} = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^d n_i \mathbf{b}_i | n_i \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
\,,
\eea
where $\mathbf{b}_i$ is the $i$th primitive vector of the Bravais lattice.
And a plane wave on the $d$\dmn\ lattice is:
\bea
f_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{z}) = e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{z}}
\, ,
\eea
where $\mathbf{z}$ is the position of a lattice site, and $\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector.
The periodicity given by the Bravais lattice $\lattice$ requires that:
\bea
f_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{z}+\mathbf{R})
=f_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{z})\,,
\quad
\mathbf{R} \in \lattice \,.
\eea
This condition can only be satisfied if the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ exists on the
reciprocal lattice of the lattice $\lattice$:
\bea
\overline{\lattice} = \left\{ \sum_{j=i}^d n_i \mathbf{b}_i | n_i \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
\,,
\eea
the basis vectors of which satisfy:
\bea
\mathbf{b}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_j = 2 \pi \delta_{ij} \,.
\eea
Using these eigenvectors we can transform {\lattstate}s into reciprocal {\lattstate}s
by discrete Fourier transform.
Any {\lattstate} with the periodicity given by the Bravais lattice
$\lattice$ can be spanned by the plane waves with wave vectors in the
reciprocal lattice $\overline{\lattice}$. And since a {\lattstate} only has
values on lattice sites, we only need a finite number of plane waves to
span the {\lattstate}.
%For each {\lattstate} with periodicity given by a Bravais lattice,
%there exists a reciprocal {\lattstate}.

When we write period-$\cl{}$ {\lattstate}s as $\cl{}$\dmn\ vectors, and write the
shift operator $\shift$ as a $[\cl{} \times \cl{}]$ matrix \refeq{hopMatrix} which applies
cyclic permutation to the
{\lattstate}, the matrix representation of shift operators forms a permutation representation
of the cyclic translation group $\Cn{n}$. This permutation representation is a reducible
representation, i.e., it can be block diagonalized by a similarity transformation. Each block
on the diagonal is an irreducible representation (irrep).

The abelian group $\Cn{\cl{}}$ only has 1\dmn\ irreps. The permutation
representation of $\Cn{\cl{}}$ can be diagonalized by discrete Fourier transform. After the
transform the representation of the shift operator becomes,
\bea
\shift^{m}=
\left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
1 \\
& \omega^m \\
& & \omega^{2m} \\
& & & \ddots \\
& & & & \omega^{(\cl{}-1)m}
\end{array}
\right) \,,
\quad
\omega=\e^{2\pi\mathrm{i}/\cl{}}
\,,
\eea
with {\lattstate}s projected onto 1\dmn\ subspaces
in which action of the shift operators is given by corresponding irrep.
As we transform the permutation representation of the shift operator into the block
diagonal form,
the {\lattstate}s
$(\ssp_{0},\ssp_{1},\ssp_{2},\dots,\ssp_{\cl{}-1})$
are spanned by the  Fourier modes basis,
with components
$(\cssp_{0},\cssp_{1},\cssp_{2},\dots,\cssp_{\cl{}-1})$.
When the shift operator acts on the {\lattstate}: $\Xx \to \shift \Xx$, the irreducible
representations act on the components in the corresponding subspace:
$\cssp_{k} \to \omega^k \cssp_{k}$.

%\subsubsection
{\bf Dihedral group}
%\label{sect:LC21irrepsDn}

In the $\cl{}$\dmn\ space of the period-$\cl{}$ {\lattstate}s, the permutation representation
of the Dihedral group \Dn{\cl{}} can be generated by the shift operator matrix representation
\refeq{hopMatrix} and the reflection operator matrix representation:
\bea
\Refl=
\left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
 1 &&&&0\\
  &  &  & 0 & 1 \\
  &  & \reflectbox{$\ddots$} & 1 &  \\
  & 0 & \reflectbox{$\ddots$} &  &  \\
  0& 1 &  &  &  \\
\end{array}
\right) \,.
\eea

The Dihedral group $\Dn{\cl{}}$ has: 2 1\dmn\ irreps and $[(\cl{}-1)/2]$
2\dmn\ irreps if $\cl{}$ is odd,
or 4 1\dmn\ irreps and $(\cl{}/2-1)$ 2\dmn\ irreps if $\cl{}$ is even.
If $\cl{}$ is odd, the permutation representation can be block diagonalized into irreps:
$A_0 \oplus E_1 \oplus \dots \oplus E_{(\cl{}-1)/2}$.
If $\cl{}$ is even, the permutation representation can be block diagonalized into irreps:
$A_0 \oplus B_1 \oplus E_1 \oplus \dots \oplus E_{\cl{}/2-1}$.
