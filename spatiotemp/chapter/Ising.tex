A wild idea, to keep in mind, if we get to the point where QFT is within
reach.
`Fundamental domain' appears in an interesting stat mech context in Wipf
\etal\rf{WKWTP06,WHKW07} {\em Generalized {Potts-models} and their
relevance for gauge theories}. They study the 3-state Potts model, a
natural extension of the Ising model with 3 vectors at each site, whose
global symmetries are point group \Cn{3}, and the 1d lattice of discrete
translations. The domain of the traced Polyakov loop variable (?) for
\SUn{3} is a triangle, with a  \Cn{3} fundamental domain. Then they
compute leading terms in the strong coupling limit using characters
$\chi_{pq}$ for the \SUn{3} representation $(p,q)$. These characters
transform under \Cn{3}, so they restrict calculations to the fundamental
domain inside the above triangle. Or perhaps \Dn{3}, could not tell in my
first, very superficial reading. These articles were immediately followed
up by a bunch of other articles - there are too many quantum field
theorists out there:)

In other words, Potts model could provide a bridge from Boris' cat maps to
QFT on lattices.

There is also a continuation with $G_2$ Yang-Mills by the same authors,
but that's for another, more ambitious time...

Not quick or easy to explain, but I have a hunch that the spatiotemporal
zeta function should be something like the 2D Ising model zeta function
described by Aizenman \HREF{160913IsingZeta.pdf} {(click here)}. It
should assign a weight for every spatiotemporal domain, described by its
2D symbolic dynamics.

qmath16 Aizenman talk notes (mostly gibberish - my fault):

It is known (?) that QM is emergent from the \emph{classical} stat mech
of Ising models. Key tools: Pfaffians. Random current representation of
Ising.

Groenevald-Boel-Kasteleyn'78: describe correlations in the planar Ising
model, by boundary segments, ordered cyclically. Pfaffian refers to
spin-spin correlations along the boundary. There is a parity sign that
makes it a non-interacting fermion model.

Aizenman et al. extend it to nonplanar modles, where planarity
\emph{emerges} at the critical point. ADTW'16 proof utilizes the
\emph{random current representation}. Starts with high temperature
expansion. Partition function is a sum over loops. In a correlation,
sources are connected pairwise by lines, ie, Gaussian limit. Above
critical dimension - four - the theory is free (sum of products over
pairs). In 2D, fermionic case, you get Pfaffian. Leads to the
integrability of the model. (Read Chelkak-Cimasoni-Kassel '15.)

``Almost planar"

Order-disorder variables.

Aizenman: Two implications of planarity

1) For any planar graph, and a symmetric edge function
\[
{\cal F}(\{K_\theta\}) = \det(1-K{\cal W})
\]
is the \emph{square of a multilinear function} of the parameters
\(
\{K_\theta\}_{\theta \in \epsilon_0}
\,.
\)
This is proven through a reduction to an antisymmetric matrix $A$, and
(Kasteleyn matrix '63):
\[
\det (A) = \mbox{Pf}[A]^2.
\]


For planar models, done by Kac-Ward. Works for any planar graph
(``amorphous graphs''), not only on a regular lattice.

2) For any planar loop of oriented non-backtracking edges
\(
\{e_1, e_2, \cdots\}
\)
\[
\prod_{j=1}^n {\cal W}_{e_{j+1},e_j} = (-1)^{w(\rho^*)}
             = (-1)^{n(\rho^*)}
             \,.
\]
with $w(\rho^*) =$ winding number, and $n(\rho^*) = \#$~of {self
crossings } [Whitney's Thm].

This is then combined with the \emph{Ihara relation}, for matrices indexed by
oriented edges:
\[
\det(1- KW)_{\epsilon_0\times\epsilon_0}
= \prod_{\ell}\left[
            1+(-1)^{n(\ell)} \chi_{-K}(\ell)
            \right]^2.
\]
the product being over unoriented loops on $\mathbb{G}$ (hence the power 2).

particular limit.

The original proof of Kac and Ward\rf{KacWar52} famously contained an
error. We refer the reader to \refref{KaLiMe13} for a longer discussion
on the history of this theorem. The main improvement here, in comparison
with \refref{KaLiMe13},  is that there is no need for expanding the
generating functions into generating functions of collections of loops.
The combinatorial mechanism of the Kac-Ward formula is here as
transparent as the one of the loop-erased walks.

We discuss a generic model of Bayesian inference with binary variables

Chertkov and Chernyak\rf{CheChe06,CheChe06} is used to evaluate the
resulting series expansion for the partition function. We show that, for
planar graphs, truncating the series at single-connected loops reduces,
via a map reminiscent of the Fisher transformation\rf{Fisher61}, to
evaluating the partition function of the dimer-matching model on an
auxiliary planar graph. Thus, the truncated series can be easily
re-summed, using the Pfaffian formula of Kasteleyn\rf{Kasteleyn61}. This
allows us to identify a big class of computationally tractable planar
models reducible to a dimer model via the Belief Propagation (gauge)
transformation. The Pfaffian representation can also be extended to the
full Loop Series, in which case the expansion becomes a sum of Pfaffian
contributions, each associated with dimer matchings on an extension to a
subgraph of the original graph. Algorithmic consequences of the Pfaffian
representation, as well as relations to quantum and non-planar models,
are discussed.

``
As the seminal work of Onsager\rf{Onsager44} on the two-dimensional Ising
model and its combinatorial interpretation by Kac and Ward\rf{KacWar52}
have shown, the planarity constraint dramatically simplifies statistical
calculations.
''

Onsager\rf{Onsager44} computed the free energy, and Yang\rf{Yang52}
obtained a formula for the magnetization.  In particular, this formula
implies that the magnetization is zero at criticality. These results have
been reproved in a number of papers since then. See Werner\rf{Werner09}
for a recent proof.

Onsager's computation of the free energy is based on the study of the
eigenvalues of the so-called transfer matrices. The original strategy
used by Onsager is based on the fact that the transfer matrix is the
product of two matrices whose commutation relations generate a finite
dimensional Lie algebra. Later on, Kaufman\rf{Kaufman49} gave a simpler
solution using Clifford algebra and anti-commuting spinor (free-fermion)
operators.

The most famous expansions of the partition function are called the low
and high temperature expansions. An expansion in terms of subgraphs of
the original graph, called the random-cluster model, was found by Fortuin
and Kasteleyn\rf{ForKas72}. The strength of all these expansions is that
they work for all graphs. They do not lead to an explicit computation of
the partition function or the free energy, but they provide new insight
and often highlight specific properties of the model.

Ivashkevich, Izmailian and Hu\rf{IvIzHu02} {\em Kronecker's double series
and exact asymptotic expansions for free models of statistical mechanics
on torus}:

Consider a
planar square lattice of size $M\times N$ with periodic boundary
conditions, i.e. torus. To each site $(m,n)$ of the torus a spin
variable is ascribed, $s_{mn}$, with two possible values: $+1$
or $-1$. Two nearest neighbor spins, say $s_{mn}$ and
$s_{m,n+1}$ contribute a term $-J\,s_{mn}\,s_{m,n+1}$ to the
Hamiltonian, where $J$ is some fixed energy. Therefore, the
Ising model
Hamiltonian is the sum of all such terms, one for each edge
of the lattice
\begin{equation}
H(s)=-J\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}
\left(s_{mn}\,s_{m+1,n}+s_{mn}\,s_{m,n+1}\right)
\label{IsingHamiltonian}
\end{equation}
(Predrag:) Note that this can be written in terms of a shift matrices
$\sigma_j$ as
\[
H(s)= %s_{mn}\,s_{m+1\,n}+s_{mn}\,s_{m,n+1}
      -J\,\transp{s}\cdot(\sigma_1+\sigma_2)\cdot{s}
\,,
\]
which looks asymmetric - check whether this has a lattice
Laplacian formulation?

The partition function of the Ising model is given by the sum over
all spin configurations on the lattice
%\begin{equation}
$$ Z_{\rm Ising}(J)=\sum_{\{s\} }e^{-H(s)} $$
%\end{equation}
It is convenient to set up another parameterizations of the
interaction constant $J$ in terms of the mass variable
$\mu=\ln\sqrt{{\rm sh}\,2J}$. Critical point corresponds to the
massless case $\mu=0$.

An explicit expression for the partition function of the Ising model on
$M \times N$ torus, which was given originally by Kaufmann\rf{Kaufman49},
can be written as
%Onsager's explicit expression for the partition function of the
%Ising model can be written as \cite{Onsager}
\begin{equation}
Z_{\rm Ising}(\mu)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sqrt{2}e^{\mu}\right)^{MN}

Z_{0,\frac{1}{2}}(\mu)+Z_{\frac{1}{2},0}(\mu)+Z_{0,0}(\mu)\right\}
\label{ZIsing}
\end{equation}

boundary conditions
\begin{equation}
Z^2_{\alpha,\beta}(\mu)=
\prod_{n=0}^{N-1}\prod_{m=0}^{M-1}4\left[\textstyle{

\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi (m+\beta)}{M}\right)+2\,{\rm sh}^2\mu
\;}\right]
\label{Zab2}
\end{equation}
Here $\alpha=0$ corresponds to the periodic boundary conditions
for the underlying free fermion in the $N$-direction while
$\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$ stands for anti-periodic boundary conditions.
Similarly $\beta$ controls boundary conditions in $M$-direction.

partition function
the partition function with twisted boundary conditions
$Z_{\alpha,\beta}$ can be transformed into simpler form
\begin{equation}
Z_{\alpha,\beta}(\mu)=\prod_{n=0}^{N-1} 2\left| \textstyle{~\!{\rm
sh}\left[M\omega_\mu\!\left(\frac{\pi(n+\alpha)}{N}\right)+i\pi\beta
\right] }\right| \label{Zab}

where lattice dispersion relation has appeared
\begin{equation}
\omega_\mu(k)={\rm arcsinh}\sqrt{\sin^2 k+2\,{\rm sh}^2\mu}
\label{SpectralFunction}
\end{equation}
This is nothing but the functional relation between energy
$\omega_\mu$ and momentum $k$ of a free quasi-particle on the
planar square lattice.

It is interesting to discuss this problem in terms of the

the shape of the 2D lattice may be represented by the imaginary number
\beq
  z = 1/a + i \ c.
\ee{Cardy86-1}
Then, Cardy asserted that the partition function becomes invariant
under the transformations
\beq
  z \rightarrow z + i
\ee{Cardy86-2}
and
\beq
  z \rightarrow 1/z,
\ee{Cardy86-3}
in the limit that the system size becomes infinite.

We have another invariant transformation
\beq

\ee{Cardy86-4}
which corresponds to the fact that we can confine $c$ to the interval
of $0 \le c \le 1/2$.
Starting from the recurrence relation
\beq
  z_{n+1} = \frac{1}{z_n+i} + i,
\ee{Cardy86-5}
we can easily show that (recheck! $\period{}$, $\speriod{}$ rewrite wrong

\beq
A=a/(c^2 a^2+1)
 =\frac{\period{}}{\speriod{}}

%\bibitem{zlk99}
Ziff, Lorentz and Kleban\rf{ZiLoKl99}
{\em Shape-dependent universality in percolation},
\arXiv{cond-mat/9811122}.

The torus with a twist has various topological symmetries
that apply to any shape-dependent universal quantity $u(r,t)$.  We consider a rectangular boundary
with base 1 and height $r$, with a horizontal twist $t$ in the
periodic b.~c. \   (Note that having twists in two directions leads to a
non-uniform system, so we don't consider it.) \   $u(r,t)$ satisfies the obvious symmetries
of reflection
\begin{equation}
u(r,t) = u(r,-t)
\label{eq:reflection}
\end{equation}
and  periodicity in the $t$ direction
\begin{equation}
u(r,t) = u(r,1+t)
\label{eq:periodicity}
\end{equation}
Another symmetry follows from the
observation that the same rhombus can be made into a rectangle
in two different ways, leading to:
\begin{equation}
u(r,t) = u\left({r \over r^2 + t^2},{t \over r^2 + t^2}\right)
\label{eq:inverse}
\end{equation}
Another construction
shows that when  $t = 1/n$ where $n$ is an integer,
\begin{equation}
u\left(r,{1 \over n}\right) = u\left({1\over n^2 r},{1 \over n}\right)
\label{eq:integer}
\end{equation}
which also follows from Eqs.\ (\ref{eq:reflection}-\ref{eq:inverse}). On
the complex $\tau = t + ir$ plane, (\ref{eq:inverse}) corresponds to
$\tau \to 1/\tau$ while (\ref{eq:periodicity}) corresponds to $\tau \to
\tau + 1$.  These transformations generate the modular group, and
functions invariant under them are called modular.  Thus, $b(r,t)$ must
necessarily be a modular function.

Besides the excess number, another universal
 quantity on a torus is the cross-configuration probability
$\pi_+(r,t)$, which can be expressed in a quite compact form.
Things veer off to Dedekind eta function and such, and Predrag gives up.

Liaw \etal\rf{LHCLL06} {\em Partition functions and finite-size scalings
of {Ising} model on helical tori}:
The exact closed forms of the partition functions of a two-dimensional
Ising model on square lattices with twisted \bcs\ are given.

A helical
torus is related to the twisted boundary conditions tiling by an
$\SLn{2}{\integers}$ transformation. In $d=2$, the equivalence
transformations among the Bravais cell vector-pairs preserve
the area and are thus $\SLn{2}{\integers}$. This is the prototype of the
modular symmetry of the conformal field theory.%\cite{cardyz}.

In \reffig{LHCLL06fig1} they make a distinction between
the \emph{`helical'}, and the equivalent \emph{`twisted'} tiles.

Helical tori are tiled by pairwise joining the edges of the
rectangle spanned by any orthogonal set of vectors on the lattice plane.
This leads to distinct orientations of the underlying lattice, labelled
by the chirality~{[sahito]} as well as the chiral aspect ratio. The
conventional periodic $BC$ is referred as the helical Bravais cell with trivial
chirality, as depicted in \reffig{LHCLL06fig1}\,(a).

The twisted $BC$  Bravais cell is a modification to the
conventional Bravais cell by cutting the torus and then rejoining after twisting.
Twisted tori are what we call Hermite normal form Bravais cells.
There are two types of twisting: $Tw_{I}(M,N,d/M)$ Bravais cell specified by
 $\{\overrightarrow{a}_{1}=M{\hat{x}}+d{\hat{y}},%
\overrightarrow{a}_{2}=N{\hat{y}}\}$, and $Tw_{II}(M,N,d/N)$ Bravais cell
specified by $\{\overrightarrow{a}_{1}=M{\hat{x}},\overrightarrow{a}_{2}=d{%
\hat{x}}+N{\hat{y}}\}$ used in \refref{CL18}.

In CL18\rf{CL18} notation:
$Tw_{II}(\speriod{},\period{},\tilt{}/\period{})$ Bravais cell is
specified by\\
$\{\overrightarrow{a}_{1}=\speriod{}{\hat{x}},
   \overrightarrow{a}_{2}=\tilt{}{\hat{x}}+\period{}{\hat{y}}\}$.

It suffices to study the
unique correspondence of a helical torus to the one of the above twistings,
say $Tw_{I}$.

The helical tori Bravais cell is given by the orthogonal basis vector pair,
\begin{eqnarray}
{\overrightarrow{a}}_{1}^{\prime } &=&{\hat{x}}\ P_{1}+{\hat{y}}\ Q_{1},
\nonumber \\
{\overrightarrow{a}}_{2}^{\prime } &=&-{\hat{x}}\ Q_{2}+{\hat{y}}\ P_{2},
\label{eq17}
\end{eqnarray}%
where the two radii for the torus are given as
$L_{i}=\sqrt{P_{i}^{2}+Q_{i}^{2}}$ for $i=1,2$. They denoted the helical
system by $Hl(B,L_{1},\chi)$, where the chiral aspect ratio
$B=L_{2}/L_{1}$ and the chirality $\chi =Q_{1}/P_{1}\equiv{Q}_{2}/P_{2}$.
In order to furnish the equivalent structure
$Hl(B,L_{1},\chi)\cong{Tw}_{I}(A,M,\alpha )$,
$\mathcal{M}_{11}={P_{1}}/{M}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{21}=-{Q_{2}}/M$ implies
that
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{M}_{21} &=&-B\chi \mathcal{M}_{11}  \label{eq17_1} \\
1 &=&\mathcal{M}_{11}\mathcal{M}_{22}\ -\ \mathcal{M}_{21}\mathcal{M}_{12}.
\label{eq18} \\
A &=&\frac{\left( \mathcal{M}_{21}\right) ^{2}}{B}+B\left( \mathcal{M}%
_{11}\right) ^{2},  \label{eq19} \\
\alpha &=&-\frac{\mathcal{M}_{21}\mathcal{M}_{22}}{B}-B\mathcal{M}_{11}%
\mathcal{M}_{12}.  \label{eq20}
\end{eqnarray}%

The helical Bravais cell is a subclass of twisted one
by an $\SLn{2}{\integers}$ equivalence relation, \reffig{LHCLL06fig1}\,(c)
and \refeq{eq:inverse}.

They refer to  $\alpha=d/M$  (our notation: $\alpha=\tilt{}/\period{}$)
as a ``twisting factor".

$Q_{M,N}^{\alpha}=Q_{M,N}^{-\alpha }$ as twisting either clockwise or
counterclockwise is not distinguished by the energy. Note that reversing
the sign of a twist factor $\alpha$ is not an $\SLn{2}{\integers}$ transformation.

The $[M\times N]$ square lattice with the helicity factor
$d=D/M$, the system has
periodic boundary conditions in the N direction and
helical (tilted) boundary conditions in the M direction such
that the i-site in the first column is connected with the
$\mod(i+D, M)$th site in the N column of the lattice.

{\em Anisotropic scaling of the two-dimensional {Ising} model {I:} the torus}:
They compute the partition function and the free energy of the finite
two-dimensional square lattice Ising model with periodic boundary
conditions.

The problem of finding the generating function of the closest-packed
dimer configurations on an arbitrary planar graph was solved by Kasteleyn
in terms of Pfaffians, as it gives the number of \textit{perfect
matchings} of a given directed planar graph with an even number of sites.
This is especially powerful because of the connection between the
Pfaffian and the determinant, namely
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DetPfaffianRel}
	\left(\Pf{\mathcal A}\right)^{2}=\det{\mathcal  A}.
\end{align}
[...]
The nearest-neighbour structure in a row and a column are both
represented by the $[n \times n]$ matrix
%
\begin{align}
	\setlength{\arraycolsep}{8pt}
	{\bf H}_{\mathsf{b},n} = \begin{pmatrix}
		0		& 1	& 0	& \cdots	& 0		\\
		0		& 0 	& 1	&		& 0		\\
		\vdots	&	&	& \ddots	& \vdots	\\
		0		& 0	& 0	&		& 1		\\
		-\mathsf{b}		& 0	& 0	& \cdots	& 0	
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
%
with $\mathsf{b}\in\{+1,0,-1\}$ accounting for
$\mathsf{b}=0$ open, $\mathsf{b}=+1$  periodic, and
$\mathsf{b}=-1$ for anti-periodic boundary conditions.
%, concerning the necessity of transition cycles on the graph to be odd.
$\mathsf{b}=-1$ accounts for periodic boundaries on the
directed graph, i.\,e., in the dimer system, in the sense that all edges
are likewise aligned, while it accounts for antiperiodic BCs in the Ising
model.
However, the topology of the underlying directed graph is not
representative for the Ising model, which is emphasised by the fact that
the Ising partition function is a combination of four Pfaffians.

[...]
the characteristic polynomials are
%
\beq
	\mathcal{P}^{\pm}_{\mathsf{\beta}}(N;\varphi)
    =\prod_{m=0}^{N-1}\left(e^{\pm\ii\varphi}
                        - e^{\ii\varphi_{m}^{(\mathsf{\beta})}}\right)
    = e^{\pm\ii N \varphi} + \mathsf{\beta}
\ee{eq:CharacteristicPolynomialPM}
%
with
%
\begin{align}
	\varphi^{(\mathsf{\beta})}_{m}=\begin{cases}
   		2m\pi/N 		& \text{if } \mathsf{\beta} = -1 \\
   		(2m+1)\pi/N	& \text{if } \mathsf{\beta} = +1
  	\end{cases}
\end{align}
%
for $m\in\{0,1,2,\dots,N{-}1\}$, and thus we will call
$\mathsf{\beta}=-1$ \textit{even} and $\mathsf{\beta}=+1$ \textit{odd}.
Note that the eigenvalues lie equidistantly on the unit circle and thus
we have a free shifting parameter for the spectrum.
We have chosen it in such a way, that the eigenvalue $\varphi_0^{(-)}=0$
appears in the even spectrum; a shift by $-\pi$ on the other hand would
have given rise to a dependency on whether $N$ is even or odd.

Characteristic polynomials \refeq{eq:CharacteristicPolynomialPM} have a
simple scaling form as one only have to replace $\varphi=\Phi/N$ to
obtain
%
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:CharacteristicPolynomials}
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{P}^{\pm}_{e}(\Phi)=e^{\pm\ii\Phi}-1,\\
	\mathcal{P}^{\pm}_{o}(\Phi)=e^{\pm\ii\Phi}+1
\,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
%where the $\pm$ accounts for the two possible choices of the eigenvalue
%$\ee^{\pm\ii\varphi^{(\cM)}_{m}}$ in \refeq{eq:HDiagonal}.

They compute variety of determinants. Particularly suggestive is the
product formula for translational invariance in both directions, their
eq.~(2.32), that looks like Han's determinant. This was previously
computed by McCoy \& Wu for the anisotropic torus\rf{McCWu73}.
There is an interesting matrix for the torus, their eq.~(4.3).
All in all, looks harder than what we need for the \catlatt.
