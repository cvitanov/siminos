     Dedicated to Fritz Haake 1941--2019\rf{GGSZ21}
\end{quote}



The year was 1988.
Roberto Artuso, Erik Aurell and P.C. had just worked out the cycle
expansions formulation of the deterministic and semiclassical chaotic
systems\rf{AACI,AACII}, and a Niels Bohr Institute ``Quantum Chaos
Symposium'' was organized to introduce the new-fangled theory to
unbelievers (for a history, see \toChaosBook{section.A.4} {Append.~A.4
{\em Periodic orbit theory}}).
In the first row of the famed auditorium, where long ago Niels Bohr and
his colleagues used to nod off, sat a man with an impressive butterfly
and a big smile. At the end of our presentation, Fritz --for that was
Fritz Haake-- stood up and exclaimed

\begin{quote}

     ``Amazing! I did not understand a single word!''
\end{quote}

And indeed, there is a problem of understanding what is `chaos' as
encountered in different disciplines, so we start this offering to Fritz
Haake's memory by {`a fair coin toss'} theory of chaos,
\refsect{s:coinToss}, as was presented in the 1988 symposium, but in a
modern, field theorist's vision. In those days `chaos' was a phenomenon
exhibited by low-dimensional systems. In this and companion papers%
\rf{CL18,CL18,GuBuCv17} we explain how to think of `chaotic' or
`turbulent' $\infty$\dmn\ deterministic field theories.
Chaotic field theory is of interest on its merits, as a method of
describing turbulence in strongly nonlinear deterministic field theories,
such as \NS\ or \KS\rf{GudorfThesis,GuBuCv17}, or as a Gutzwiller WKB
`skeleton' for a chaotic quantum field theory\rf{gutbook,CFTsketch}
or a stochastic field theory%
\rf{noisy_Fred,conjug_Fred,diag_Fred,LipCvi08,CviLip12}.
The
lattice reformulation aligns `chaos' with standard solid state, field theory
and statistical mechanics, but the claims
% and companion papers\rf{CL18,GuBuCv17}
are radical: we've been doing `turbulence' all wrong.
% and we have known that since Poincar{\'e}'s times.
In ``explaining'' chaos we talk the talk
as though we have never moved beyond Newton; here is an initial state of
a system, at an instant in time, and here are the differential equations
that evolve it forward in time. But when we -all of us- walk the
walk, we do something altogether different
(see the references preceding \refeq{nXdCycle}), much closer to the 20th
century spacetime physics. Our papers realign the theory to what we
actually {\em do} when solving `chaos' equations, using not much more
than linear algebra.
In the field-theoretical formulation, there is no evolution in time, and
there is no `Lyapunov horizon'; every contributing {\em \lattstate} is a
robust global solution of a \spt\ fixed point condition, there is no
dynamicist's exponential blowup of initial state perturbations.

To a field theorist, the fundamental object is \emph{global}, the
partition function sum over probabilities of all possible spacetime field
configurations.
To a dynamicist, the fundamental notion is \emph{local}, an ordinary or
partial differential time-evolution equation. From the field-theoretic
perspective, the spacetime formulation is fundamental, elegant and
computationally powerful, while moving in step-lock with time is only one
of the methods, an inelegant `transfer matrix' method for construction of
the partition sum, awkward and computationally unstable. The two ways of
constructing partition sums are related by Hill's formulas,
\refsect{s:LC21Hill}.
{Hill's formula} says that a higher-order derivative equation can be
written as a set of first order ODEs, a relation equally applicable to
mechanical, energy conserving systems, as to the viscous, dissipative
systems.

As a gentle introduction
for a reader too busy\rf{focusPOT} to study the book\rf{ChaosBook}, we
disguise a brief course on chaos theory as something everyone
understands, a Bernoulli coin toss, \refsect{s:coinToss}. In
\refsect{s:1D1dLatt} we reformulate the for\-ward-in-time Bernoulli map as
the `{temporal Bernoulli}' discrete lattice problem.

The second time,
as a `\templatt', a 1\dmn\ lattice of coupled rotors that all dynamicists
understand, \refsect{s:kickRot}. In \refsect{s:catLagrange} we introduce
the `\templatt', a lattice reformulation of the cat map.

Its spacetime generalization, the simplest of all chaotic field theories,
the `\catlatt'\rf{GutOsi15,GHJSC16,CL18}, is a discretization of the
Klein-Gordon equation, a deterministic scalar field theory on a $d$\dmn\
hyper-cubic lattice, with an unstable ``anti-harmonic" rotor $\ssp_{z}$
at each lattice site $z$, a rotor that gives, rather than pushes back,
coupled to its nearest neighbors.
In contrast to its elliptic sister, the Helmholtz equation and its
oscillatory solutions, {\catlatt}'s {\lattstate}s are hyperbolic and
`turbulent', just as in contrast to oscillations of a harmonic
oscillator, Bernoulli coin flips are unstable and chaotic.

The third time,
we generalize the approach in \refsect{s:henlatt} %{s:nonlinFT}
to nonlinear field theories.

The deep insight
here is the realization that the {\em\HillDet}, \ie, the volume of the
{\em\jacobianOrb} (\reffig{fig:BernCyc2Jacob} and \ref{fig:catCycJacob})
partitions system's \statesp.

The deep insight here is that the two formulations of mechanics, the
for\-ward-in-time Hamiltonian evolution, and the global, Lagrangian,
{\templatt} formulation are related by the {\em Hill's formula}.

Next, we address two questions:
(i) how is the high-dimensional orbit \jacobianM\ $\jMorb$ related
to the temporal [$d\!\times\!d$] \jacobianM\ $\jMat$?
(\refsect{s:LC21Hill}),
and
(ii) how does one evaluate the orbit \jacobianM\ $\jMorb$?
(\refsects{sect:LC21recip1d}{sect:LC21recip1d}).


In \refsect{s:latt1d} we show that the partition function of a
given field theory is determined by the group of its symmetries, \ie,
by the space group of its lattice discretization,
and its reciprocal lattice, \refsect{sect:LC21recip1d}.
In particular, from a \spt\ field theory perspective, `time'-reversal is
a purely crystallographic notion, leading to a perhaps unfamiliar
symmetry quotienting of `time-reversible' theories.

The theory is compactly summarized by its {\tzeta} \refeq{Isola90-13}
that counts Bravais lattices.

On the level of counting lattice-states, their {\tzeta}s are purely
group-theoretic Lind zeta functions, see \refsect{sect:LC21Lind1d}.

Our results are summarized and open problems discussed in the
\refsect{s:summary}.
