\section{Temporal lattice}
\label{s:TempLatt}
% excerpted from \Chapter{cycles}{28sep2019}{Fixed points, and how to get them}
%
Assume that a \po\ $\ssp(\period{p}+\zeit)=\ssp(\zeit)$ of a continuous
time flow
\(
\dot{\ssp}=\vel(\ssp)
\)
is known `numerically exactly', that is to say, to arbitrary (but not
infinite) precision. One way to present the solution is to give a single
point $\ssp(0)$ in the orbit, and let the reader reconstruct the orbit
$p$ by integrating forward in time,
$\ssp(\zeit)=\map^\zeit(\ssp(0))$, $\zeit\in[0,\period{p}]$.

However, for a linearly unstable \po\ a single point does not suffice to
present the orbit, because there is always a finite `Lyapunov time'
$\zeit_{Lyap}$  beyond which $\map^\zeit(\ssp(0))$ has lost all memory of
the \po\ $p$. This problem is particularly severe in searches for {`\ecs
s'} embedded in turbulence, where even the shortest period solutions have
to be computed to the (for everyday fluid dynamics excessive) machine
precision\rf{GHCW07,channelflow,openpipeflow} in order to complete the
first return to the initial state.

Instead of relaying on forward-in-time numerical integration,
\emph{global methods} for finding periodic orbits\rf{ChoGuck99} view them
as equations for the vector fields $\dot{\ssp}$ on spaces of closed
curves. In numerical implementations one discretizes the \po\  $p$ into
sufficiently many short
segments\rf{auto,GM00aut,ChoGuck99,DingCvit14,DCTSCD14}, and lists a
point for each segment
\beq
p=(\ssp_1,\ssp_2,\cdots,\ssp_\cl{p})
\,.
\ee{nXdCycle}
For a $d$\dmn\ discrete time map $\map$ obtained by cutting the flow by a
set of {\PoincSec s}, with the \po\ $p$ of discrete period $\cl{p}$,
every segment can be reconstructed by a short time integration, and
satisfies
\beq
\ssp_{k+1}=\map(\ssp_k)
\,,
\ee{CyclePntErr}
to high accuracy, as for sufficiently short times the exponential
instabilities are numerically controllable.

So, how accurate is such an orbit, \ie, how fast do errors grow for such
globally specified orbit?
In numerical work we know the cycle points only to a finite precision
\beq
\hat{p}=(\hat{\ssp}_1,\hat{\ssp}_2,\cdots,\hat{\ssp}_\cl{p})
\,,\quad
\hat{\ssp}_k = \ssp_k+\deltaX_k
\,,
\ee{nXdCycleErr}
where $\ssp_k$ are the exact \po\ points.
Define the error field by $F(\hat{p})=\map(\hat{p})-\sigma\hat{p}$, an
operator which compares the forward map of every point in $\hat{p}$ with
the next point $\sigma\hat{p}$, a $(\cl{p}\!\times\!d)$\dmn\ vector field
obtained by stacking $\cl{p}$ \statesp\ points $\hat{\ssp}_k$
\beq
 F(\hat{\ssp}) \, = \, F
\left (
\begin{array}{l}
 \hat{\ssp}_1 \\ \hat{\ssp}_2 \\ \cdots \\ \hat{\ssp}_\cl{p}
\end{array}
\right )
=
\left (
\begin{array}{l}
  \hat{\ssp}_1 - \hat{\map}_\cl{p} \\ \hat{\ssp}_2 - \hat{\map}_1 \\
  ~~~\cdots \\ \hat{\ssp}_\cl{p} - \hat{\map}_{\cl{p}-1}
\end{array}
\right )
\,,\qquad \hat{\map}_k = \map(\hat{\ssp}_k)
\,,
\ee{errorVecs1D}
which measures the misalignment of every finite forward-in-time segment
$\map(\hat{\ssp})_k$ with the next listed point $\hat{\ssp}_{k+1}$ on the
\po.

By \refeq{CyclePntErr}, the exact discretized cycle \refeq{nXdCycle} is a
zero of this vector field, $F(\ssp)=0$.
Assuming that the $d$\dmn\ vectors $\deltaX_k$ are small in magnitude, and
Taylor expanding the {one discrete time-step} map $\map$ to linear order
around the exact solution,
\[
\map(\ssp_\zeit + \deltaX_\zeit)
   = \ssp_{\zeit+1} + \jMat_\zeit \deltaX
    + (\cdots)
%\,,\qquad \map_\zeit = \map(\ssp_\zeit) = \ssp_{\zeit+1}
\,,
\]
where
\beq
[\jMat_\zeit]_{ij} = \frac{\pde \map_i(\ssp_\zeit)}{\pde \ssp_j}
    \,,\quad
\zeit
    = (1,2,\cdots,\cl{p})
    \,,\quad
i,j
    \,=\, (1,2,\cdots,d)
\label{Hill:FntTimeJac}
\eeq
one finds that the neigh\-bor\-hood of entire cycle $p$ is
linearly deformed by the $[\cl{p}d\times\cl{p}d]$ orbit \jacobianM\
\beq
    \deltaX' = \jMorb(\ssp) \, \deltaX
    \,, \qquad
\jMorb_{ij}(\ssp)
  =  \frac{\pde F(\ssp)_i}{\pde \ssp_j}
\,,

\[
\jMorb \,=\,
1 - \sigma \jMat

Next, we address two questions:
(i) how is the high-dimensional orbit \jacobianM\ $\jMorb$ related
to the temporal [$d\!\times\!d$] \jacobianM\ $\jMat$?
and
(ii) how does one evaluate the orbit \jacobianM\ $\jMorb$?

% ``Hill's formula''
To summarize, a discretized, temporal lattice \po\ linear stability can
be computed in two ways - either by computing the
$[\cl{p}d\times\cl{p}d]$ \jacobianM\ $\jMorb(x)$, or by computing $\jMat_p$
\beq
|\Det \jMorb_p| = |\det (1-\jMat_p)|
\,,
\ee{dissipHill}
where $\jMat_p$ is the $\cl{p}$ time-steps $[d\!\times\!d]$ forward-time
\jacobianM. In the limit of discretization $\cl{p}\to\infty$ the left
hand side is a {\em functional} determinant of an $\infty$\dmn\ {\em
operator}. Nevertheless, thanks to the discrete Fourier diagonalization
of $\jMorb(x)$, \refappe{appe:Fourier}, the determinant $\Det \jMorb_p$ is easier to compute
than the ill-posed $\jMat_p$.
    \PC{2019-10-10}{
$\jMorb(x)$ is block-diagonalized by the discrete Fourier transform on a
periodic lattice of three sites.
Write up next the discrete Fourier evaluation of $\Det \jMorb_p$.

    }

The projection operator on the $k$th Fourier mode is
\beq
P_k = \prod_{j\not= k}^{} \frac{\shift-\omega_j \id }
                           {\omega_k - \omega_j}
\,.
\ee{hToN-ProjOp}
The set of the projection operators is complete,
\beq
\sum_k P_k = \id
\,,
\label{compl-ProjOp}
\eeq
 and orthonormal
\beq
P_k P_j = \delta_{kj} P_k
 \qquad (\hbox{no sum on} \ k)
\label{orthon-ProjOp}
\,.
\eeq

\section{\Spt\ lattice}
\label{s:SptLatt}

In \spt\ settings, $\jMat_p$ can be defined only for finite numbers of
spatial sites, and it gets funkier and funkier as the spatial direction
increases (that is why we are able to work only with very small spatial
domain \KS\ discretizations). But, as shown for the \catlatt\ in
\refref{CL18}, $\Det \jMorb_p$ works just fine on any
\spt\ torus. In particular, for any \twot\ \KS\ discretization.
