What is a natural way to cover the torus, in such a way that the dynamics and
the partition borders are correctly aligned? You are allowed to coordinatize
the unit torus by any set of coordinates that covers the torus by a unit area.
The origin is fixed under the action of ${\bf A}$, and straight lines map into
the straight lines, so Adler and Weiss did the natural thing, and used
parallelograms (following  Bowen\rf{Bowen70} we shall refer to such
parallelograms as `rectangles') with edges parallel to the two eigenvectors of
${\bf A}$. Adler and Weiss observed that the torus in the new eigen-coordinates
is covered by two rectangles, labelled $A$ and $B$ in \reffig{fig:Lect13p8}.

%    \PCpost{2016-12-26}{
As illustrated in \reffig{fig:CatMapStatesp}, the action of the
cat map in the \PV\rf{PerViv}  ``two-configuration
representation'' is given by the antisymmetric  area
preserving $[2\!\times\!2]$ matrix
\beq
{\bf A}
=\MatrixII{0}{1}
          {-1}{s}
\ee{PerViv:2confRepMat}
For the Arnol'd value $s=3$,
in one time step the map stretches the unit square into a parallelogram, and
than wraps it around the torus 3 times, as in \reffig{fig:CatMapStatesp}.
Visualise the phase space as a bagel, with $\ssp_0$ axis a circle on the
outside of the bagel. This circle is divided into three color segments, which
map onto each other as you got in the $\ssp_1$ axis direction.  Now apply the
inverse map - you get 3 strips intersecting the the above strips, for 9
rectangles in all: a full shift, \ie, a ternary Smale horseshoe. So on the
torus there are only 3 strips - there is no distinction between the two outer
letters $\Ae=\{-1,2\}=$
\{%
{\color{red}red},
{\color{yellow}yellow}%
\},
it is the same third strip. The division into 2 triangles is an artifact
of plotting the torus as a unit square. All
complicated pruning of (the current draft of) Gutkin \etal\rf{GHJSC16}
is a red herring, due to over-partitioning of the
torus with a 4-letter alphabet.

{\em This is stupid.}

How do \AW\ coordinates work out for the Arnol'd cat map in the \PV\
representation \refeq{PerViv:2confRepMat} used here?
First one needs to construct the eigen-coordinates.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\hfill         \fastTrackExam{exam:ProjOpCatMap}

For $s>2$ the stability multipliers
\(
(\ExpaEig^{+},\ExpaEig^{-})
\,=\,(\ExpaEig\,,\; \ExpaEig^{-1})
\)
are real,
\beq
\ExpaEig^{\pm}=\frac{1}{2}(s\pm \surd{D})
\,,\qquad
\ExpaEig=e^{\Lyap}
\,,
\ee{catEigs}
where
\bea
s&=&\ExpaEig+\ExpaEig^{-1}
  =  2\cosh(\Lyap)
    \,,\quad
    \continue
\surd{D}&=&\ExpaEig-\ExpaEig^{-1}
  =  2\sinh(\Lyap)
\label{catEigs1}
\eea
 discriminant $D=s^{2}-4$,
with a positive Lyapunov exponent $\Lyap >0$,
and the right, left eigen\-vectors:
\bea
\{ \jEigvec[+],\jEigvec[-] \} &=& \left\{
    \VectorII{\ExpaEig^{-1}}{1}
    \,,
     \VectorII{\ExpaEig}{1} \right\}
    \continue
\{ \jEigvecT[+],\jEigvecT[-] \} &=& \left\{
   [-\ExpaEig^{-1},1]
    \,,
    [\ExpaEig,-1] \right\}
\,,
\label{eigVecs}
\eea
(where the overall scale is arbitrary).
As the matrix is not symmetric, the
$\{\jEigvec[j]\}$ do not form an orthogonal basis.

What does this do to the partition of \reffig{fig:CatMapStatesp}? The origin
is still the fixed point. For a \statesp\ point in the new, dynamically
intrinsic right eigenvector \AW\ %\rf{AdWei70}
coordinate basis $x'$
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
 \ssp_{t-1}'  \\
 \ssp_{t}'
 \end{array} \right )
 =
\left(\begin{array}{c}
 -\ExpaEig\ssp_{t}+\ssp_{t-1}\\
 -\ExpaEig^{-1}\ssp_{t}+\ssp_{t-1}
 \end{array} \right )
\,.
\]
the abscissa ($\ssp_{t-1}$ direction) is not affected, but the ordinate
($\ssp_{t}$ direction) is flipped and stretched/shrunk by factor $-\ExpaEig$,
$-\ExpaEig^{-1}$ respectively,
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
 \ssp_{t}'  \\
 \ssp_{t+1}'
 \end{array} \right )
 =
 \MatrixII{\ExpaEig^{-1}}{0}
          {0}            {\ExpaEig}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
 \ssp_{t-1}'  \\
 \ssp_{t}'
 \end{array} \right )
 - \left(\begin{array}{c}
 0  \\
 \Ssym{t}
 \end{array} \right )
\,,
\]
preserving the vertical strip nature of the
partition of \reffig{fig:CatMapStatesp}. In the \AW\ right eigenbasis,
${\bf A}$ acts by stretching the $\jEigvec[+]$ direction by $\ExpaEig$, and
shrinking the $\jEigvec[-]$ direction by  $\ExpaEig^{-1}$, without any rotation
of either direction.

Thus the \AW\ coordinates preserve the convenient feature of the
\PV\ cat map, \reffig{fig:CatMapStatesp}: the torus `rewrapping'
translations remain all vertical, specified by a single integer.

The angles of stable / unstable manifolds are irrational respective to the
lattice, and they never hit another vertex (and so they do not close onto
themselves under quotienting of translations).

Given the stable/unstable eigenvectors, the

drawn in \reffig{fig:PCLect13p8}\,(a). The point is, after a
linear change of coordinates one has finite grammar \AW\ symbolic
dynamics, and the symbolic dynamics is a linear code in sense of Boris,
but this time with all admissible sequences generated as walks on
a \markGraph\ isomorphic to the one in \reffig{fig:Lect13p8}\,(c).

I actually like better the three-rectangle, time reversal symmetric

Thus we have constructed \PV\ cat map coordinate transformation
from the square to the intrinsic \AW\ eigencoordinate basis. This is a
LINEAR transformation. As this has been falling on deaf ears for last few years,
let me say it again:

\bigskip\bigskip

This is a {\Huge LINEAR code},

\bigskip\bigskip

\noindent
as is every code in
Chaos\-Book, as illustrated by the examples of \refsect{exam:tentMapSymbDyn} that
I worked out for feline pleasure some years back. Got that?

As \AW\ partition is generating, there is noting for Dirichlet boundary
conditions Green's functions to accomplish - all admissible symbol {\brick s} are
known. The problem is now \emph{trivial}, in the Soviet sense (\ie, after a few years of
work, I understand it).

\bigskip

What is wrong with the argument so far? I used Newtonian, evolution-in-time
thinking to generate the $d=1$ partition. That will not work in higher
dimensions, so the above argument has to be recast in the Lagrangian form.

\bigskip

%Next: show that for $s=3$ the linear code in the new basis labels a
Be my guest - I'm going to bed:)

\bigskip

A few side, symmetry related remarks: we \emph{must} quotient translation
symmetries, do calculations in the elementary cell or, better still, the
fundamental domain.

``Completely chaotic systems are comparatively well understood, but they
have been neglected as a starting point for the study of systems with
divided phase space. It is the purpose of this and related papers to
remedy this.''

``When one starts with an integrable system, and perturbs it to introduce
some chaos, new orbits and new classes of orbits keep on appearing by
bifurcation processes, and they are very difficult to follow or to
classify. It is better to start with a purely chaotic system and then
reduce the chaos by \emph{removing} orbits.''
    \PC{2016-05-29}{totally agree - they say it well}

``In this paper we present the symbolic dynamics of the sawtooth maps,
and in the companion paper\rf{PerViv87b} {\em Arithmetical properties of
strongly chaotic motions} the number theory for the \po s of
the automorphisms of the torus, including the cat maps.''

``we start with the simplest systems that show the phenomena of
interest-area preserving maps. The sawtooth maps are piecewise linear
systems. They depend on a parameter K and for positive K they are
completely chaotic. For positive \emph{integer} K they are automorphisms
of the torus, of which the simplest is the Arnol'd-Sinai cat map, with K
= 1. We shall refer to all such toral automorphisms, with positive
integer K, as cat maps. They are Anosov systems, continuous on the torus.
On the other hand, when K is not an integer, the sawtooth map is
discontinuous.''

``Most of this paper is concerned with a `linear code' for the symbolic
dynamics of the sawtooth maps, including the cat maps. This code is
chosen for its convenience in practice, and differs from the usual codes
for the Arnol'd-Sinai cat.''

``In section 3 a practical problem of stabilisation is considered, that
provides a concrete model for the sawtooth and cat maps, and a natural
introduction to the linear codes. An explicit linear transformation from
the itinerary to the orbit is given.''


    \PC{2016-06-02}{verbatim from Keating\rf{Keating91a}}
Every Anosov diffeomorphism of the torus is topologically conjugate to a
hyperbolic automorphism. These are represented by [$2\!\times\!2$] matrices with
integer entries (for continuity), unit determinant (for area
preservation) and real eigenvalues (for hyperbolicity), and are known as
cat maps.

In order to describe certain collective properties of cat map orbits
Hannay and Berry\rf{HanBer80} introduced a function  closely related to
the least common multiple of their periods.

{\em {$\zeta$}-functions and distribution of \po s of toral automorphisms}

\PCedit{ % 2016-06-02
Bellissard's friend Isola gives counting formulas of the usual type -
could easily be turned into examples/exercises for Chaos\-Book. But I am
looking for symbolic dynamics - not even mentioned here.
        }

We consider canonical automorphisms of the torus $T^2$, i.e. maps of the form
\[
T(x, y) = (ax + by, cx + dy)\quad \mod 1
\,,
\]
which are implemented by the group of [2x2] matrices with integer entries,
determinant 1, and eigenvalues \refeq{PerViv3.7}.

To study the properties of this dense set of unstable \po s,
observe that the \po s of T consist precisely of those points
having rational coordinates $(p_l/q_l, p_1/q_2)$.
If $p_1$, $q_1$ are coprime and $g$ is the least common multiple of $q_1$
and $q_z$, then the square lattice of size $l/g$ is invariant under $T$.

In this direction, Percival and Vivaldi\rf{PerViv,PerViv87b,BirViv} have
constructed a nice translation of the dynamical problem into the language
of modular arithmetic, allowing a profound understanding of the structure
of {\po s}.
Here, however, we follow another approach where a general expression for
the N's is derived through a simple iterative scheme.
Consider the numbers
\beq
u_n = \frac{\Lambda^n - \Lambda^{-n}}{\surd{D}}
 \,.
\ee{Isola90-4}
The first two terms of the series are $u_0 = 0$, $u_1 = 1$ and each term after
is given by
\beq
u_n = s u_{n-1} -u_{n-2}
 \,.
\ee{Isola90-5}

[stuff to work out:
Isola has nice figures that illustrate the partitions of the 2-torus]

For the number of periodic points he finds, for any integer $s>2$
\beq
N_n = \Lambda^n + \Lambda^{-n} -2
 \,,
\ee{Isola90-11}
in agreement with the numerics of \refref{OzoHan84}.
Walters\rf{Walt82} defines the topological entropy as
\beq
h = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}{\ln N_n}
 \,,
% ChaosBook \label{h-top}
\ee{Isola90-12}
This yields $h = \log \Lambda$, \ie, the Sinai theorem for the entropy of an
automorphism\rf{ArnAve,sinai76}.

The {\tzeta} for cat-map class of models is
\beq
\zetatop(z)  = \frac{(1 - \Lambda z) (1 - \Lambda^{-1} z)}
                  {(1 - z)^2}
           =  \frac{1 - s z + z^2}
                  {(1 - z)^2}
 \,.
\ee{Isola90-13b}
The denominator $(1 - z)^2$ takes care of the over-counting of the fixed point
at the origin due to the 2-periodicity on the torus.
\PC{2016-06-02}{
I wonder whether the fact that this is quadratic in $z$ has something to do
with the time-reversibility, and the unsigned graph's Ihara zeta functions,
see \refsect{sect:Ihara} and \refeq{AABHM99-56e}.

He also gives the number of {\orbit}s of period $n$,
which is as usual given in terms of the Moebius function $\mu(m)$,
\beq
P_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{m|n}\mu(m) N_{n/m}

\ee{Creagh94-11}

It is possible to construct a symbolic coding
with finite grammar, as described in Devaney\rf{deva87}.
Robinson\rf{Robinson12} goes through the construction clearly, step by step.
The coding is constructed for an antisymplectic
map whose double iteration is \refeq{Creagh94-11} - orbits of the cat
map are then coded by sequences whose length is even. A
brief summary of the construction follows (see Devaney\rf{deva87} for
figures and details). The stable and unstable manifolds coming
from the fixed point at $(q,p) = (0,0)$ are used to divide
the phase space into 3 rectangles $R_1$, $R_2$ and $R_3$. Under iteration
of the antisymplectic map, $R_1$ is mapped into $R_2 \cup R_3$, $R_2$
into $R_1 \cup R_3$ and $R_3$ is mapped completely into $R_2$. Therefore
orbits of the antisymplectic map are coded by sequences
of 3 symbols (1,2,3), where 1 must be followed by 2 or 3, 2
is followed by 1 or 3, and 3 must be followed by 2. The full
cat map is coded by even sequences of symbols following
the same grammar. We can alternatively code orbits of the
full map with 5 symbols denoting the admissible pairs of the
symbols above: $(a,b,c,d,e) = (12,13,21,23,32)$.


The integers that must be subtracted from the phase
space coordinates following application of the linear map in
\refeq{Creagh94-11} in order to take the point back into the unit torus are
fixed for each pair of symbols.
The equation
defining a \po\ can be written out as an
explicit affine equation and solved for each itinerary.
In this way a complete list of primitive {\po s} is obtained for the unperturbed map.

Earlier work:
Rykken\rf{Rykken98} constructed new types of Markov partitions.
Snavely\rf{Snavely91} studied the connectivity matrices of Markov partitions
for hyperbolic automorphisms of $T^2$. He found that for Berg partitions the
connectivity matrices are conjugated to the dynamics. He also found a way to
list all such matrices and hence to classify the shapes of Berg partitions. He
relied on the result of Adler\rf{Adler98} that such partitions are indeed
present for any toral automorphism.
Manning\rf{Manning02} gave a powerful generalization of this to $T^n$.

Anosov, Klimenko and Kolutsky\rf{AnKlKo08} give an introduction to Anosov
diffeomorphisms, ways to represent their chaotic properties and some historical
remarks on this subject:
`` As far as we know, the first example of such kind was
pointed out by J.~Hadamard about 1900. A couple of decades earlier H. Poincar\'e
discovered the ``homoclinic points'' which now serve as
the main ``source'' of ``chaoticity''; however, Poincar\'e himself spoke only
that the ``phase portrait'' (\ie, the qualitative picture of trajectories'
behaviour in the phase space) near such points is extremely complicated.
A couple of decades after Hadamard, E.~Borel encountered a much simpler
example of the ``chaoticity'' where it is easy to
understand the ``moving strings'' of this phenomenon. We shall begin with
a description of his example. About 100 years later it remains the simplest
manifestation of the fact that a dynamical system (which, by definition, is
deterministic) can somehow resemble a stochastic process.''

\item[2011-05-14 Jean-Luc Thiffeault]
I figured
out that the grouping of \po s is crucial, and moreover that there is
something delicate with the fixed point of the cat map, which lies on the
boundary of Markov boxes.

\item[2011-05-14 Predrag]
For Anosov (linear Anosov?) - Arnol'd cat map - it should work like ton of
rocks, but you have to note that because of the periodicity there is one
fixed point, not two. If you screw up an early term in the series, then
it converges very slowly. I think the Stephen Creagh\rf{Creagh94} tested
it on weakly nonlinearly perturbed cat map (weakly, so golden-mean
grammar is working) and it converged super-exponentially (you know the
grammar, flow has bounded hyperbolicity, so weight-truncated cycle
expansions are not needed - they perform less well).

\item[2011-05-14 Jean-Luc Thiffeault]
I know how to do it with the Markov partition now, and it works much better.
Keep in mind this is a warmup problem: what I really have in mind (with
my collaborator Erwan Lanneau\rf{LanThi11}) is to compute {\po s} for
Teichmuller flow, where the {\po s} themselves are actually now
pseudo-Anosovs!

\item[2011-05-16 Hans-Henrik Rugh]
% Hans-Henrik.Rugh@math.u-cergy.fr
The situation as I recall it is roughly as follows:

When you construct the symbolic dynamics you may start by picking one
\po, typically the fixed point  $p=f(p)$  (but the following
depends on the choice).  You then cut the torus into pieces following
$s/u$-manifolds until you get a small collection of $N$ rectangles.
\[
R_1,\cdots,R_N
\]
Associated to this collection you have a transition matrix (for SINGLE
rectangles).  Now, you also need to construct a transition matrix for
PAIRS of rectangles, e.g.  $(R_1,R_2)  \to  (R_2,R_1)$ and then TRIPLES of
rectangles ... $(R_1,R_2,R_3) \to (R_2,R_1,R_3)$, etc....
These k'th - order transitions comes from the fact that there is a fixed
point/periodic cycle on the boundary of the Markov partition elements.

You get determinants   $d_k(z)$ for each of these k'th–order transition matrices.
 NB :
$(R_1,R_2) \to (R_2,R_1)$  is a \po\ of prime length 2 even if
it represents a fixed point of f. I think (but is not sure?) that the
weights in the determinant are calculated in the same way...

The final determinant is
\(
d(z)=d_1(z)d_3(z)... / (d_2(z) d_4(z)...)
\)
if I am not mistaken. This is related to the so-called Manning trick\rf{manning} for
counting real orbits related to
\[
\det (1 - s) = 1 - \tr s + \tr s \wedge s
- \cdots
\]
where $s$ is a permutation.
What is not obvious is that $d(z)$  is entire, but it is!

%\item[2011-05-18 Hans-Henrik Rugh]
It's a kind of model problem anyway. In more realistic systems I suppose
that one may run into the problem of having several orbits on boundaries.

One of the tricky points is to see how such an orbit in the `higher'
order zeta-functions/Fredholm-det.

As mentioned in e.g. $d_1(z)$ a 'physical' fixed point may appear
zero times, or twice, or,...? In $d_2(z)$ a fixed point may actually appear
as a period two orbit, so should be treated as such when looking for
cancelling terms.

Great, if you have managed to make it work in practice.
I don't think that one can call it a standard trick but one may perhaps
get it implicitly from the paper of Ruelle\rf{Ruelle90}. But it is
difficult to digest and even more difficult to convert into computable
formulae.

    \PCpost{2018-02-10}{
Manning\rf{manning} writes: ``
According to Bowen\rf{Bowen70}, a Markov partition is a finite cover of \statesp\
by closed subsets called \emph{rectangles}. The rectangles are pairwise disjoint
except possibly for the intersection of their boundaries.
[...]
At the boundaries of the rectangles, that is where they intersect,
several periodic points individual rectangles may be mapped to the same periodic
point in the full \statesp.

``
Counting the periodic points involves also certain auxiliary subshifts of finite
type to remedy overcounting of points in the boundaries of the rectangles.

which maybe figures out cat map symbolic dynamics. He writes:

``
Updated notes: on page 4-5 I used the Markov boxes to compute the PO
expansion.  I used a trick to deal with the orbit on the boundary:
include several copies of the orbit, but divide by the correct factor.
It makes the series very nicely convergent.  I don't know if this is a
standard trick but it seems to work well.

It is standard, it is in ChaosBook.org Chapter {\em Counting}, Sect {\em
Counting cycles}. I introduced it in Roberto Artuso, Erik Aurell and
Predrag Cvitanovi\'c\rf{AACII}, {\em Recycling of strange sets: II.
applications}, see eq.~(4) and Fig.~6, but Manning\rf{manning} did it it
in 1971 (if that's what he did), and Ruelle\rf{Ruelle90} at the same
time, according to Hans Henrik.
Chaos\-Book says: ``Smale\rf{smale_61} conjectured rationality of the zeta
functions for Axiom A diffeomorphisms, later proved by
Guckenheimer\rf{Guckenh77} and Manning\rf{manning}," and Chaos\-Book cannot
be wrong.

The rule of thumb is that all credit should go to old white male
mathematicians whose names one knows how to spell.

The argument is something like this: the correct object, the Fredholm
determinant, can be written as ratios of products of skew products (AKA
determinants of different dimensions), each one being the not correct
object, but historically the first thing written down (dynamical or
Ruelle zeta function).

The ones on partition boundaries (what I currently call `ridges') are of
lower dimensions, either downstairs or upstairs in these rations. They
account for overcounting of the boundary fixed and periodic points.

Chaos\-Book does something of that when explaining the relation between
Fredholm determinants and dynamical zeta functions, but is so far silent
on explicit examples of the Manning multiples. That is why I would really
like us to write up the cat map symbolic dynamics simply and elegantly.
Jean-Luc is not the only person who has gotten lost here, anybody
mathematician who thinks that Arnol'd is the simplest exercise to try
sinks precisely at this spot (physicists train on unimodal maps and the
3-disk system, remaining blissfully ignorant of the Manning multiples)

Hans Henrik might have more elegant way of saying this. Vivianne still more elegant.

I've been dreaming about this forever, see for example my post
of {\bf [2012-03-01]}, \texttt{pipes} repository,
{\em A letter to our experimental friends}:

``
For large aspect systems I imagine we fit local \template s whose 2\dmn\

interaction of close-by structures, but small enough not to track weakly
interacting ones.

In other words, cover 3\dmn\ volume with a finite-size \template\ that
tracks a neighborhood for a finite time. It's OK to make it spatially
periodic, as long as distance is measured in finite size spatiotemporal
windows. That is what we already do when we use unstable \po s - we use
 temporally-infinite periodic solution (that cannot be seen in
experiment) to identify a finite-time neighboring segment of a chaotic
trajectory.

It has not been tried, so I might be wrong (again).

I am not suggesting that we should study this, but it's something to
maybe keep in mind:
Slipantschuk, Bandtlow and Just\rf{SlBaJu16}, {\em Complete spectral data for
analytic {Anosov} maps of the torus}, construct a family of analytic
hyperbolic diffeomorphisms of the torus (of which Arnol'd cat map is a special
case) for which the spectral properties of the associated transfer operator
acting on a suitable Hilbert space can be computed explicitly. They introduce
an example of an analytic hyperbolic diffeomorphism on the complex unit
torus, of which the cat map is a special, linear case. the real
representation of the map, Eq.~(2) is area-preserving and thus provides an
example of a chaotic Hamiltonian system. Unlike  the  situation  for
one-dimensional  non-invertible  maps, here  is  no distinction  between
{\FPoper}s  and  Koopman  operators  as   diffeomorphism is
area-preserving.


Note that the eigenvalues of the evolution (transfer) operators come in
doublets or quadruplets, presumably because of the discrete symmetries of the
unit square.

Just looking at their Figs.~1 is inspirational.

The cat map can always be written as a composition of area preserving
orientation reversing linear automorphisms.
They define a two-parameter area-preserving family, Eq.~(85), and show that
measures for such maps, where the determinant of the Jacobian varies, may have
fractal properties, see Fig.~2.

Weirdly, Wolfram's Weisstein\rf{WolframArnCatMap} is wrong: what he calls
\HREF{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LyapunovCharacteristicExponent.html}
{``Lyapunov characteristic exponents''} for Arnol'd cat map are
certainly not ``exponents'' but multipliers. Maybe you guys could alert
him, ask him to fix it.

The eigenvectors are correct. They are the same for all periodic points and thus
parallel: cat map is uniformly hyperbolic (the same stability exponents for all
orbits), a nice example of the Anosov Axim A system, with the stable and
unstable manifolds transverse everywhere, at the same intersection angle.

As no one has written anything down, I am not sure what happened in the
rest of the WebEx session, but my impression is that perhaps we
should step a step back back and first work through some
more introductory material for cat-map dynamics to start making sense.
Do not be discouraged - it is all very different in flavor from what
one learns in most traditional physics courses (though once you learn
the stuff, deep connections to statistical mechanics emerge).
My recommendation is that Rana and Adrien work through
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/course1/Course2w9.html} {week 9},
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/course1/Course2w10.html} {week 10},

According to \reftab{tab:LHarnoldPruned}, there is a single new pruning rule
for each prime-number period. Li Han lists it as 2, but
by the reflection symmetry there is only one. One should really
quotient the symmetry, and it is not just by removing overall factor 2 in the table:
there are pruning {\brick s} that map into each other by the reflection
symmetry, and there are pruning {\brick s} that are self-dual under reflection,
giving one pruning rule rather than two in the not-desymmetrized listing

{han/catMapItiners.pdf} on the cat map symbolic sequence, mostly about
the empirical (polynomial) fit of the total and new pruning rules
$\tilde{N}_{n}$, table~II, which displays the ``anomalous" behavior with
periodicity of 6, i.e. at
\[
n = 2+6m =  2,8,14,20,\cdots \qquad m=0,1,2,3,\cdots

At even lengths $n = 2\ell$ there are always 2 new pruning rules

$\{-1,0,0,··· ,0,-1\}$ and (reflection symmetry related sequence)

At $n = 2$ the anomalous new pruning rules are vanishing.

Still a mystery: why anomalies at 2, 8, 14, ...? and
what will be further occurrences? Explicit formula?

What's so unique about primes? I think that if cycle period $n-1=p$ is a
prime, there is always one ``most monotone $(p+1)$-cycle'' such that cycle
points order themselves monotonically along the spatial coordinate $q$,
\[
q_{1/(p+1)} < q_{2/(p+1)} < \cdots  < q_{p/(p+1)}
\,,
\]
and one would have to show that this forces $1 < q_{p/(p+1)}$, so that one
$(p+1)$-cycle is pruned, but all the rest are somehow protected and fall
within the unit interval. Keating\rf{Keating91a} is all about {\orbit}s,
so maybe this is explained there - of if not there, maybe in
\PV\rf{PerViv87b}? Percival and Vivaldi\rf{PerViv} and Boris' Green's
functions are polynomial functions of $s$, so maybe the answer is there
already.

What about non-prime periods $n=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m$? Perhaps on has to
replace the cat map $f$ by the commuting set of maps $f_{p_\ell} =
f^{p_\ell}$, one for each prime, and argue about pruning rules for
$f^n=f_{p_1}\circ f_{p_2}\circ\cdots\circ f_{p_m}$. Will be messy.
But while cat map $f$ is linear in $s$, $f_{p}$ are polynomial in $s$,
and that might lead to Li Han's polynomials for $\tilde{N}_{n}(s)$.

has no choice but to read it :)

They assert that for the Arnol'd cat map there are 11\,440\,548 orbits of
period 20.

                                                                \toCB
Percival and Vivaldi\rf{PerViv} refer to the discrete Laplacian as the
``central difference operator.''

The special case $s = 2$ corresponds to an unperturbed twist map, for which
orbits represent uniform motions of a free rotor.

The one-parameter $s$ family of sawtooth maps (of the 2-torus), within which
reside infinitely many Anosov diffeomorphisms. Sawtooth maps are piecewise
linear, and for this reason we are able to construct the parameter dependence
of the sawtooth orbits explicitly in terms of rational functions with integer
coefficients.

(i) for integral $s$ the sawtooth map reduces to a toral automorphism, and
the structure of {\po s} of such maps is known\rf{PerViv87b}. They
are found to coincide with points having rational coordinates, and can be
dealt with using arithmetical techniques,  one can locate and
count all {\po s}.

(ii) if an orbit is known for one value of $s$, it can be computed for any
other value.

We represent orbits as doubly infinite sequences of integers (words), where
the integers are drawn from a finite set (alphabet). An orbit is written in
terms of the configuration coordinate $\ssp_t$ alone and is denoted by  $(\ssp_t)$.
The word we denote by $(\Ssym{t})$. For $s > 2$ the code is an isomorphism.
For a given $s$, the possible values of the $\Ssym{t}$ are bounded in magnitude by
\(
|\Ssym{t}| \leq Int (1 + s/2)
\,. %(2.4)
\)
The itinerary of a given orbit is independent of the parameter.
The orbit is recovered by Green's function \refeq{GreenFun00a}:
\beq
q_{t} =  \frac{1}{{\surd{D}}}  % 2018-02-15 Predrag error? PV notation: {\surd{D}}
\sum_{s \in \naturals} \frac{1}{\ExpaEig^{|t-s|}}\,b_{s} \quad,
\label{BirVivx=b}
\eeq
The leading eigenvalue of the cat map {\jacobianM} $M$ is
given by \refeq{catEigs}.
% $\ExpaEig= (s+\surd{D})/2$, where $D={s^2 -4}$.
For an $n$-cycle $\ssp_{t}$ are rational functions of $\ExpaEig$, given by
the quotient of two reflexive polynomials
(for example, $P_t(\ExpaEig)= \ExpaEig^n P_t(1/\ExpaEig)$),
\bea
\ssp_{t} &=&  \ExpaEig \,{P_t(\ExpaEig)}/{Q(\ExpaEig)}
        \continue
P_t(\ExpaEig) &=&  \sum_{\tau=1}^{n-1}
                   \ExpaEig^{n-\tau}(\ExpaEig\,\Ssym{t+\tau-1} + \Ssym{t-\tau})
        \continue
Q(\ExpaEig) &=&  (\ExpaEig^2 - 1)\,(\ExpaEig^n - 1)
\label{BirViv(3.5)}
\eea
Bird and Vivaldi\rf{BirViv} then discuss pruning, give formulas for the
numbers of {\orbit}s for integer $s$, \etc. Most likely Li Han's
polynomials are implicit in these formulas.

{\bf Going catty}:
What is the main question? \textbf{My Question of the Day} is:

In Chaos\-Book Diffusion chapter we show that whenever the critical point of
the 1D sawtooth map (the rightmost highest point) is pre-periodic, we have
finite grammar and an analytic cycle expansion formula (essentially the
\tzeta, with the uniform expansion rate stuck into $z^n$)
for the diffusion constant.

As far as I can tell, both you and Boris ignore the issues of the grammar,
get some long-time limit estimate of the diffusion constant.

Usually in 2D there is a fractal set of critical points (AKA pruning front) -
we had worked it out for the Lozi map and the {\HenonMap}. If the strange set
is a strange repeller, there we have infinitely many examples of finite
grammars. But it never happens for non-repelling sets, like the cat map for
integer trace $s$. There there is a new (only one!) pruning rule for each
prime period set of cycles (ie, are we on the way to prove Riemann
conjecture?) and a messy set of rules for non-prime periods (which can be
described by a polynomial in $s$.

\noindent
\textbf{The Question}:
      Is the cat map pruning front a fractal set? Is there a systematic set
      of formulas for the diffusion constant, one for each set of grammar
      rules? Is this implicit in papers of Vivaldi and/or Keating?

I'm a attaching the list of \reftab{tab:LHarnoldPruned}, generated by Li Han.
He (and not only he) operates on a different astral plane, so getting him to
commit his results to our blog or draft of the paper is harder than pulling
teeth . He has the grammar rules count to length 17 and the polynomials in
$s$, but that I have only seen on his laptop screen.

PS - I am throwing in for a good measure a tent map,
\refsect{exam:tentMapSymbDyn}, to illustrate what these polynomials in the
stretching rate ($s$ for cat, $\Lambda$ for tent) are.

Now, what was YOUR main question that is still blowing in the wind?

The main question, as I thought of it in my work of many years
ago\rf{ArtStr97} (see ChaosBook.org Appendix {\em Statistical mechanics
applications}, included in this blog as \refchap{c-appendStatM}), was to
understand the behavior of $D$ as $K \to 0$, since it seems to get an extra
factor $D\sim K^{2.5}$, while $D\sim K^2$ is the usual quasilinear result.
The \PV\ linear code seemed to me appealing since it selects
allowed itineraries within a sort of rhombus in many dimensions, and the
symbols are directly linked to transport, while usual Markov partitions for
integer $K$ are not. My thought was that non-integer $K$ behavior could be
linked to the number of lattice points within the ``rhombus", and that the
$K$ correction (as well as oscillations with respect to quasilinear
estimate), could be related to estimates of errors in volumes \emph{vs.}
number of lattice points (something like
Dyson-Bleher\rf{BleDys94,BleDys94a,BleDys94b,Bleher99} work for ellipses).

\remark{Pythagorean tiling}{\label{rem:PythagorTiling}
or \emph{two squares tessellation} is a tiling of a

four squares of the other size on its four sides
(see \HREF{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tiling}
{wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean\_tiling}).
This tiling has four-way rotational symmetry around each of its squares. When
the ratio of the side lengths of the two squares is an irrational number such
as the golden ratio, its cross-sections form aperiodic sequences with a
Fibonacci-type recursive structure.
It has a cyclic set of symmetries around the corresponding points, giving it
\textbf{p4} symmetry: square lattice, point group $C_4$, two rotation centres
of order four (90${}^0$), and one rotation centre of order two (180${}^0$). It has no
reflections or glide reflections.
It is a chiral pattern, meaning that it is impossible
to superpose it on top of its mirror image using only translations and
rotations;
a Pythagorean tiling is not symmetric under mirror reflections.
Although a Pythagorean tiling is itself periodic (it has a square lattice of
translational symmetries) its cross sections can be used to generate
