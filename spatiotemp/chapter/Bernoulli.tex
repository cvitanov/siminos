Much of ergodic theory can be illustrated by a Bernoulli
map\rf{Driebe99,BoyGor97}. One can explicitly construct a \FPoper, and
compute its eigenvalues and its eigenvectors; construct the {\dzeta}, and
count {\lattstate}s and {\orbit}s\rf{ChaosBook}.

 (for  $\shift$ written out as a matrix, see
\refeq{appe:Bern_cyc})
    }


\item[2019-07-30 Predrag]
Since all coefficients in \refeq{OneCat} are integers, the {\lattstate}s
$\ssp_\zeit$  are always rational. This allows for their exact evaluation
by integer arithmetic.

\item[2019-12-18 Predrag] (dropped from \texttt{CL18.tex})\\
Restrict the
admissible field values $\ssp_{t}$ at time-lattice site $t$ to the
symmetric unit interval $\ssp\in[-1/2,1/2)$, with ??-letter alphabet
\beq
\A=\{\underline{4},\underline{3},\underline{2},\underline{1},
     0,1,2,3,4\}
\,.
\ee{SawtoothFace6alph}

It maps the unit
interval onto itself, with fixed points $\ssp_0=0$, $\ssp_1=1$.

reduction
$\hflow{}{\ssp_{\zeit}}\mapsto\flow{}{\ssp_{\zeit}}$

Recall how the subpartitions of \reffig{fig:BernPart} were used to
obtain the total number of periodic points \refeq{noPerPtsBm}, as every
subpartition contained one and only one periodic point.

The closely related {\em sawtooth map}, sketched in \reffig{fig-d-1f},

%\,,
\label{KD-mapCL18}

 Since the relation between $\Ssym{\zeit}$ symbol
sequences and $\ssp_{\zeit}$ states is linear, it is straightforward  to
go back and forth between a {\lattstate} and its symbolic
representation.

The $n$th

known as the {\em doubling} map if ${s}=2$,
    \index{doubling map}\index{circle map}
\beq
\ssp_{\zeit+1} = 2 \ssp_{\zeit} \;\; (\mbox{mod}\;1)
%    \,,\qquad \qquad \ssp_{\zeit}\in [0,1)
\,,
\ee{DoublingMap}
and {\em ${s}$-tupling} map, \reffig{fig-d-1}\,(b), for
integer stretching parameter ${s}\geq3$,

The relation is linear, and a given \brick\ $\Mm$, or `code' in terms of
alphabet  \refeq{base-sAlph}, corresponds to a unique temporal {\lattstate} $\Xx$ given by the lattice Green's function
\beq
\Xx
= \gd\,\Mm
\,,\qquad
\gd = - \frac{\shift}{\shift - s\,\id}
\,,
\ee{appe:tempBernGreen}
provided we specify the boundary conditions ({\bcs}) for the {\shiftOp}
$\shift$.

The power of the linear encoding of the {temporal
Bernoulli} condition \refeq{1stepDiffEq} is that the
\emph{integer}-valued symbols $\Ssym{\zeit}$ from the finite alphabet
\refeq{base-sAlph} encode the \emph{real-valued} lattice site states
$\ssp_{\zeit}$.

For the  %\rf{GroFuj,art91},
piecewise linear map of \reffig{fig:BernPart}
we can evaluate the \dzeta\ in closed form.
Each branch has the same value of the
slope, and the map can be parameterized
by the single parameter ${s}$.
The larger ${s}$ is, the stronger is the stretching action of the map.

The power of the code % $\{\Ssym{\zeit}\}$
\beq
\transp{\Mm} % = \{\ssp_j\}
             = (\Ssym{\zeit},\Ssym{{\zeit+1}},\cdots,\Ssym{{\zeit+k}})
\ee{linCode}
for the {\templatt} \refeq{OneCat} is that one can use \emph{integers}
$\Ssym{\zeit}$ to encode the \emph{real-valued} {\lattstate}s $\ssp_{\zeit}$.

,
\beq
(\partial - (s-1)\,\shift^{-1})\,\Xx = -\Mm
\,.
\ee{app:1stepVecEq}

For
the $s=3$ cat map example at hand, they are
\beq
\{M_j\} = (M_1,M_2,M_3,M_4,M_5,\cdots)
=(1,2,5,10,24,\cdots)
\,,
\ee{noPrimeCycs=3}

Visualizing the volume relation \refeq{eq:fundFact} for a general \cl{}\dmn\
{\fundPip} is not easy, but

As the {temporal Bernoulli} \refeq{tempBern} is linear, eigenmodes of
$\jMorb$, shifted by $\Mm$ as in \refeq{tempBern} for each distinct
{\lattstate}, are also {\lattstate}s of {temporal Bernoulli}.


    \HLpost{2020-01-17}{
The determinant of this $\jMorb$ from \refeq{tempBern} is negative so
we cannot use the determinant trace formula directly. A correct way is:
first rewrite the $\jMorb$ as in \refeq{appe:tempBernGreen}
\[
\jMorb = \id-{s}{\shift}^{-1}
       = - \frac{s}{\shift} \left(\id-\frac{\shift}{s}\right)
\, .
\]
Note that $\det(\shift)=(-1)^{\cl{}-1}$. The determinant of $\jMorb$ is:
\[
\det \jMorb = \det(\frac{\shift}{s}-\id) s^{\cl{}}(-1)^{\cl{}-1}
   = - s^{\cl{}} \det(\id-\frac{\shift}{s}) \, .
\]
Then use the determinant-trace formula:
\[
\ln\det(\id-\frac{\shift}{s}) = \tr\ln({\id- {\shift}/{s}})
  =
-\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{k}\frac{\tr(\shift^k)}{s^k}
\, ,
\]
and use
$\tr \shift^k= \cl{}\delta_{k,\cl{}r}$ if $k$ is a multiple of $\cl{}$,
0 otherwise
(follows from $\shift^\cl{}=\id$),
\[
\ln\det(\id-\frac{\shift}{s}) = -\sum_{r=1}^\infty\frac{1}{r}\frac{1}{s^{\cl{}r}}
=
\ln(1-s^{-\cl{}})
\, ,
\]
and the determinant of $\jMorb$ is:
\[
\det \jMorb = - s^{\cl{}} \det(\id-\frac{\shift}{s}) = 1 - s^{\cl{}}
\, ,
\]
which is negative. So for the {temporal Bernoulli} the count is:
\[
N_\cl{} = |\det \jMorb| = s^{\cl{}} - 1
\, ,
\]
in agreement with the time-evolution count \refeq{noPerPtsBm}.

The action of {\jacobianOrb}
$\jMorb$ for the period-2 periodic points of the base-2 Bernoulli map,
\reffig{fig:BernPart},
which partitions the unit interval into ${2}$ subintervals
$\{\pS_\Ssym{}\}$, is
\beq
\field_{\zeit+1}
= {2} \field_{\zeit} - \Ssym{\zeit+1}
\,,\qquad  \field_{\zeit}\in\pS_{\Ssym{\zeit}}
\,,
\ee{circ-m=2}
where $\Ssym{\zeit}$ takes values in the ${2}$-letter alphabet
\beq
\Ssym{} \in \A=\{0,1\}
\,.
\ee{base-sAlph=2}

should suffice to convey the idea. In this
case, the $[2\!\times\!2]$ {\jacobianOrb}, the unit
square basis vectors, and their images are
\bea
\jMorb &=&
 \left(\begin{array}{cc}
  1 & -2 \\
 -2 &  1
 \end{array} \right)
;\quad
\Xx_B =
 \left(\begin{array}{c}
 1  \\
 0
 \end{array} \right)
\,,\quad
\Xx_D =
 \left(\begin{array}{c}
 0  \\
 1
 \end{array} \right)
\continue
\Xx_{B'}  &=& \jMorb\,\Xx_B =
 \left(\begin{array}{c}
  1  \\
 -2
 \end{array} \right)
\,,\quad
\Xx_{D'} =
 \left(\begin{array}{c}
-2  \\
 1
 \end{array} \right)
\,,
\eea
with the resulting fundamental parallelogram of area 4
shown in \reffig{fig:BernCyc2Jacob}.
The volume of the fundamental parallelogram lattice $\lattice$ \refeq{lattVol} is
\beq
\Det(\lattice) = \Det(\Xx_{B'}|\Xx_{D'})= \Det(\jMorb)\,\Det(\Xx_{B}|\Xx_{D}) = - 3
\,,
\ee{bernVol}
where in this case the unit cell matrix $(\Xx_{B}|\Xx_{D})=\unit$.


The $[3\!\times\!3]$ {\jacobianOrb} and the unit
cube basis vectors are
\bea
- \jMorb &=&
 \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
  -1  & 0 & 2 \\
  2 &  -1 & 0\\
  0 & 2 & -1
 \end{array} \right)
\,,\quad
\left(\Xx_B|\Xx_C|\Xx_D\right) =
 \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 1 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 1
 \end{array} \right)
\,.
\nnu
\eea
Clearly $\Det(-\jMorb)= {s}^3-1$, and so on, reproducing the periodic
states count for Bernoulli. No point of looking at $\Det(-\jMorb)$, as
that changes sign at every order - always evaluate $|\Det(\jMorb)|$.

\item[2020-02-18 Predrag] Clipped here from
\emph{Ising.tex}, might be relevant to generalizing
Bernoulli to 2\dmn\ lattice, as a warm-up to \catlatt\ zeta functions:

Roettger\rf{Roettger05},
{\em Periodic points classify a family of Markov shifts}, writes:

Ledrappier introduced the following type of space of doubly indexed
sequences over a finite abelian group G,
\[
X_G=\{(x_{s,t}) \in G^{\integers^2} | x_{s,t+1}=x_{s,t}+x_{s+1,t}
\quad \mbox{for all }s,t\in \integers\}.
\]
The group $\integers^2$ acts naturally on the space $X_G$ via left and
upward shifts.

\item[2020-02-19 Predrag]
Suarez\rf{Suarez89}
{\em Difference equations and a principle of double induction},
\CBlibrary{Suarez89}
studies this as a ``partial difference equations,'' that is, difference
equations in two or more variables. He refers to many books on the
subject. His example is a first order hyperbolic equation, with initial
conditions on space and time axes, which describes some thermal
properties,
\[
f(r, m) =f(r, m-1) +f(r-1, m).
%\label{Suarez89(9)}
\]
The goal is to calculate, step by step, all the values of the temperature
T(m,n), starting with the initial and boundary conditions. But then I do
not get the rest of the papers. Perhaps best not to use much time on
`\spt' Bernoulli.

    \item[2020-03-28 Predrag]
The Bernoulli % equation \refeq{circ-m}
first-order difference equation
\beq
\field_{\zeit} - {s}\field_{\zeit-1} = - \Ssym{\zeit}
\,,\qquad  \field_{\zeit} \in [0,1)
\,,
\ee{diffEqs:1stepDiffEq}
{characteristic equation} (for \Ssym{\zeit}=0)
\beq
\ExpaEig -s= 0
\,,
\ee{diffEqs:tempBern}
has one characteristic root
\(
\{s\}
\,.
\)

Comparing with \refeq{genFuncts:noPerPtsBms} we see that we need to solve
a first-order inhomogeneous difference equation with a constant forcing
term $(s-1)$.

Weijie Chen does this pedagogically in his 2011 lecture notes
\CBlibrary{Chen11}, sect.~{\em 1.2.1 One Example}, where he
considers
\beq
\field_{\zeit} - {s}\field_{\zeit-1} = {M}
\,,
\ee{Chen11:1stepDiffEq}
and finds the particular solution by taking
$\field_{p,n} = \field_{p}$ for all $n$,
\[
  \field_{p}-s\,\field_{p}={M}
  \quad \to \quad
  \field_{p} = -{M}/(s-1)
\,.
\]
Hence the solution is
\beq
\field_{n} = \field_{c,n} + \field_{p,n}
= c\,s^{n} - \frac{{M}}{s-1}
\,,
\ee{Chen11:1stepDiffSolu}
with $c$ determined by the initial value
\(
\field_{0}= c\,{s}^{0} - {{M}}/(s-1)
\,.
\)
Bernoulli starts with $\field_{0}=0$, and according to
\refeq{genFuncts:noPerPtsBms}, $M=(s-1)$, so $c=1$.

Weijie Chen also works out the particular solution when $s=1$.
                                    \toCB
He also remarks that in econometrics the {\shiftOp} $\shift$ is called
the \emph{lag operator}.

Weijie Chen solves the \templatt\ pedagogically in his lecture notes
\CBlibrary{Chen11}, sect.~{\em 2 Second-Order Difference Equation}.

Questions
\begin{itemize}
  \item
Why is it OK to take site-independent particular solution?
  \item
${{M}}/(s-1)$ looks awkward, can one reformulate? so instead of $M$, have
${{M}}/(s-1)\to1$
  \item
I am guessing that $M=(s-1)$ in \refeq{Chen11:1stepDiffEq}
something like the total number of `letters' I can add to
the count $N_n$ at time $n$. Something like that.
  \item
Similarly for $M=2{\mu}^2$ forcing term in \templatt\ second-order

To evaluate the {\HillDet} \refeq{eq:fundFact}, observe that
from \refeq{tempBern} it follows that
\[
\Det(-\jMorb)=\Det({s}/\shift)\,\Det(\id- {\shift}/{s})

It follows from $\shift^\cl{}=\id$ that
$\Tr \shift^k= \cl{}\delta_{k,r\cl{}}$ is non-vanishing
if $k$ is a multiple of $\cl{}$,
0 otherwise:
\[
\ln\Det(\id- {\shift}/{s})

For example, for ${s}=2$, the lattice fields are (they are always rational-valued),
\bea
\ssp_{\Ssym{1}\Ssym{2}\cdots \Ssym{n}}
&=&  \sum_{k=1}^\cl{} \frac{\Ssym{k}}{2^k} \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{\cl{}m}}
        = \frac{2^\cl{}}{2^\cl{} - 1} .\Ssym{1}\Ssym{2}\cdots \Ssym{\cl{}}
\continue
&=& \frac{1}{2^\cl{} - 1}\,\sum_{k=1}^\cl{} \Ssym{k} 2^{\cl{}-k}
\,,
\label{Bern_cyc1}
\eea
where $p=\overline{\Ssym{1}\Ssym{2}\cdots \Ssym{\cl{}}}$ is an {\orbit} of period
\cl{}, with stability multiplier $\ExpaEig_p=2^\cl{}$.

For a Bernoulli map,
the rational $\ssp_{0}$ are either periodic or land eventually on a \po\
(the base-${s}$ version of the familiar fact that the decimal expansion
of a rational number is eventually periodic), while the orbit of a normal
irrational $\ssp_{0}$ is ergodic.

${\MvarRed}_{\hat{\Mm}}$ in \refeq{circ/D1}: it depends on
$\hat{\Mm}$, as its diagonal takes values $\pm{s}$. We need to prove
that the \HillDet\ $\Det{\MvarRed}$ does not.

I had not noticed before that this parametrization converts
Bernoulli into tent map, with full \statesp\ 2-cycles turned
into negative slope fixed points.

By the
inclusion-exclusion principle \refeq{KlaRot97(2.1)}
\beq
N_\cl{}=
  \hat{N}_\cl{}+\Refl\hat{N}_\cl{}-\hat{N}_\cl{}\cap(\Refl\hat{N}_\cl{})

Let's call the number of points in the shared boundary $I$.
% Looks like we have to distinguish odd and even $\cl{}$.
The $\ssp=0$ is in $I$
for any $\cl{}$, if I am allowed to identify $\ssp=1\to0$,
and that is the only point in the boundary.
Presumably this leads to the denominator $(1-z)$ in
\refeq{appe:BernZeta}. I guess that the symmetric irrep of
$\Dn{1}=\{e,\Refl\}$ leads to $N_{+}=s^\cl{}$ and the numerator
$(1-{s}z)$, while the antisymmetric irrep leads to $N_{-}=0$, and a
trivial factor 1 contribution to the numerator \refeq{appe:BernZeta}.

\tempLatt\ should be more interesting. Also any nonlinear $s$-branch map
`Bernoulli-like' lattice with a \emph{dynamical} $\Dn{1}$ symmetry; then
the weights $t_p$ do not necessarily cancel for the antisymmetric irrep.

{\em On the Beta Transformation} \arXiv{1812.10593}:
The beta transformation is the iterated map \refeq{betaTransf}. The
$\beta=2$ is known as the Bernoulli map, and is exactly solvable. The Bernoulli
map provides a model for pure, unrestrained chaotic (ergodic) behavior:
it is the full invariant shift on the Cantor space. The beta
transformation defines a subshift: iterated on the unit interval, it
singles out a subspace of the Cantor space, in such a way that it is
invariant under the action of the left-shift operator. That is, lopping
off one bit at a time gives back the same subspace. The beta transform
seems to capture something basic about the multiplication of two real
numbers: $\beta$ and $x$. It offers a window into understanding the nature of
multiplication. Iterating on multiplication, one would get
exponentiation; although the mod 1 of the beta transform contorts this in
interesting ways. The work presented here is a research diary: a pastiche
of observations and some shallow insights.
 The eigenvalues of the
transfer operator seem to lie on a circle of radius $1/\beta$ in the complex
plane. Given that the transfer operator is purely real, the appearance of
such a quasi-unitary spectrum seems surprising. The spectrum appears to
be the limit of a dense set of quasi-cyclotomic polynomials, the positive
real roots of which include the Golden and silver ratios, the Pisot
numbers, the n-bonnaci (tribonacci, tetranacci, etc.) numbers.

Beta transformation
\beq
T_{\beta }(x)=\beta x\;{\mod {1}}
\,,\qquad 1<\beta\leq2
\ee{betaTransf}
was introduced by Alfr{\'e}d R{\'e}nyi\rf{Renyi57} in 1957, and an invariant measure for
it was given by Alexander Gelfond in 1959 and independently by Bill
Parry\rf{Parry60} in 1960.

\HREF{https://www.irif.fr/~numeration/OWNS}{(video)}

For greedy beta-expansions, we study some fractal sets of real numbers
whose orbits under beta-transformation share some common properties. For
example, the partial sum of the greedy beta-expansion converges with the
same order, the orbit is not dense, the orbit is always far from that of
another point etc. The usual tool is to approximate the
beta-transformation dynamical system by Markov subsystems. We also
discuss the similar problems for intermediate beta-expansions.

Flatto, Lagarias and Poonen\rf{FlLaPo94}
{\em The zeta function of the beta transformation} (1994)

which should have the $\beta=2$ Bernoulli zeta function
as the trivial case.

\item[2021-01-05 Han] Notes from Flatto, Lagarias and Poonen\rf{FlLaPo94} paper:

$\beta$-transformation map is:
\[
f_\beta(x) = \beta x \;\; (\mbox{mod}\;1) \, ,
\]
where $\beta>1$, $x \in [0,1]$. The symbolic dynamics of $f_\beta$ is based on the fact that the graph of
$f_\beta$ consists of $\lfloor \beta \rfloor + 1$ monotone pieces which they call laps, which are
assigned by the symbols $0, 1, \dots, \lfloor \beta \rfloor$. When $\beta \in \mathbb{Z}^+$,
the piece $\lfloor \beta \rfloor$ consists of a single point, and the symbol $\lfloor \beta \rfloor$
only appears in the itinerary of 1. To each $x \in [1,0]$ its itinerary is $I_\beta(x)=A_0A_1A_2\dots$,
where the symbol
\[
A_n := A_n(x) = \lfloor \beta f_\beta^n(x) \rfloor \, .
\]
In particular the itinerary of 1, $I_\beta(1)=A^*_0A^*_1A^*_2\dots$ encodes complete information about
the behavior of $f_\beta$.

They introduced a power series with integer coefficients:
\[
\phi_\beta(z) = A_0^* z + A_1^* z^2 + A_2^* z^3+ \dots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} A_n^* z^{n+1} \, .
\]
This function is related to the iterates of 1 by:
\[
\phi_\beta(z) = 1 + (\beta z - 1)\left(
\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_\beta^n(1)z^n
\right)
\, .
\]
Then the zeta function is:
\[
\zeta_\beta(z) = \frac{1}{1-\phi_\beta(z)} \, ,
\]
if $\beta$ is not a simple $\beta$-number, and
\[
\zeta_\beta(z) = \frac{1-z^N}{1-\phi_\beta(z)} \, ,
\]
if $\beta$ is a simple $\beta$-number, and $N$ is minimal with $f_\beta^N(1)=0$.
Simple $\beta$-numbers are the $\beta$-numbers such that for some $n$, $f_\beta^n(1)=0$.
This formula gives the correct topological zeta function of temporal Bernoulli.

Associated with the $\beta$-transformation is the set $X_\beta$ of all $I_\beta(x)$ for $0 \leq x <1$.
The $\beta$-shift $S_\beta$ is a symbolic dynamical system obtained as the smallest closed (two-sided)
subshift of $\{1,2,\dots \lfloor \beta \rfloor\}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ generated by all finite substrings of $X_\beta$.
For simple $\beta$-numbers $S_\beta$ is a subshift of finite type.

There is a zeta function associated to the $\beta$-shift $S_\beta$, which is studied by
Takahashi\rf{Takahashi83}, who showed that
\[
\hat{\zeta}_\beta(z) = \frac{1}{1-\phi_\beta(z)} \, .
\]
This formula is closely related to $\zeta_\beta(z)$ but differs from it for simple $\beta$-numbers,
in which case the closure operation defining $S_\beta$ adds some extra periodic points.

{\em Quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations}
\arXiv{2011.06571}:

[1] showed how to map the problem of solving a general linear differential
equation to that of matrix inversion, which can then be performed using
the quantum linear systems algorithm [12-13].   Consider a linear differential
equation of the form,
$$ {dx\over dt} + A x = b(t), \eqno(6)$$
where as above $x,b \in {\cal C}^d$ and $A$ is a $[d\times d]$ matrix.

                                                            \toCB
Discretize the equation in time at intervals $\Delta t$, and take $k$ to
be the index for the discretized time, so that $x_k$ and $b_k$ are
the values of $x$ and $b$ at time label $k$.

We wish to integrate equation
(6) numerically starting from the initial state $x_0 \equiv b_0$.   We obtain
a series of equations of the form:
$$
 x_0 = b_0 \quad
x_1 = x_0 - \Delta t A x_0 + \Delta t b_1 \quad
\ldots \quad
x_{k+1} = x_k - \Delta t A x_k + \Delta t  b_k \quad
\ldots
\eqno(7)$$
Here, we have used the Euler forward method for numerical integration, but it
is straightforward to implement implicit methods such as
Euler backward, Crank-Nicholson, Runge-Kutta, etc.~[3].
Written in matrix form, these equations become
$$-\left(\begin{array}{cccccc}
- I & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 \cr
I-\Delta t A & - I & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 \cr
0 & I-\Delta t A& -I &  \ldots & 0 & 0\cr
&&\ldots &&&\cr
0& 0 & 0 & \ldots & - I & 0\cr
0& 0 & 0 & \ldots & I - \Delta t A & - I\cr

The extension of Fredholm theory to the case of Bernoulli shift on
$\complex^{k+\alpha}$ (in which the \FPoper\ is {\em not} compact  --
technically it is only {\em quasi-compact}. That is, the essential
spectral radius is strictly smaller than the spectral radius) has been

that for the Bernoulli shift the exponential decay rate of correlations
coincides with the Lyapunov exponent: while such an identity holds for a
number of systems, it is by no means a general result, and there exist
explicit counterexamples.
