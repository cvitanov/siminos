We used to be stuck on reflection-symmetry reduction needed to factorize the
zeta functions. But no more - see

The matrix \emph{symmetry group} \Group\ of a matrix $M$:
\beq
{\cal S}(M) =   \{
             \LieEl\in\Group \mid \LieEl M \LieEl^{-1}=M
                \}
\,.
\ee{symmOfM}
The \emph{reversing} matrix symmetry group $R$ of a matrix $M$:
\beq
{\cal R}(M) =  \{
             s\in R \mid s M s^{-1}=M^{-1}
               \}
\,.
\ee{revSymmOfM}
A matrix $M$ is \emph{reversible} if
it is conjugate to its inverse within matrix group $R$.

Park\rf{Park88} refers to \refeq{shiftRefl} as `skew-commuting':\\
``The `covering space' has two actions, $\map$ and $\Refl$, where $\map$ is
a $\integers$-action, $\Refl$ is a map of order two, and $\Refl$ and T
skew-commute; that is, $\Refl\map\Refl = \map^{-l}$.''

Let $(\pS,\map)$ be an invertible dynamical system. A homeomorphism
$\Refl:\pS \rightarrow \pS$ is a \textit{flip} if
\beq
\Refl\circ\map\circ\Refl = \map^{-1}
\,,\qquad
\Refl^2=1
\,.
\ee{Ryu17eq:1.1}
The triple $(\pS,\map,\Refl)$ is called a \textit{flip system}\rf{KiLePa03}.

For a shift space a flip is a non-abelian group action, see \refeq{D_infty}.
A flip system $(\pS,\map,\Refl)$ is \textit{shift-flip system of finite type}
if $(\pS,\map)$ is a shift of finite type.


Notation follows \HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group}
    {Dihedral group}
and
\HREF{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon\#Symmetry}
{Regular polygons}  wikis.

$T$ is a normal subgroup of \Group.

For space groups, the cosets by translation subgroup $T$ (the set
all translations) form the \emph{factor} (also known as \emph{quotient})
group $\Group/T$, isomorphic to the point group $g$.
The normal subgroup of a line group  $\Group$ is its translational subgroup $T$,
with its factor group $\Group/T$ isomorphic to the \emph{isogonal point group $P$}
of discrete symmetries of its 1\dmn\ unit cell $x\in[0,1)$.


\beq
\shift_i\,\shift_j = \shift_{i+j}, \quad \shift_i\,\Refl_j
= \Refl_{i+j}, \quad \Refl_i\,\shift_j
= \Refl_{i-j}, \quad \Refl_i\,\Refl_j = \shift_{i-j}
\,,
\ee{D_nComp}
As the order in which a translation and a reflection are applied is not
commutative, dihedral groups are nonabelian.

    To omit from the paper:\\
    As any two flips result in a rotation,
    alternative presentation for
    \Dn{\cl{}}, $\cl{}$ even, is generated by a horizontal (short axis) reflection,
    and a diagonal  (long axis)  reflection, rather than the usual $(r,\Refl)$ set.
    (I have not checked this for the odd $\cl{}$.)

 an even index $2k$
reflection $\Refl_{2k}$ reflects the lattice across the  $k$th lattice
site, while an odd index reflection $\Refl_{2k+1}$ reflects the
lattice across the midpoint between sites  $k$ and $k+$.



    \begin{quote}
Definition:  {\em {\em Coset}.
Let $H = \{e, b_2, b_3, b_4, \cdots\} \subseteq \Group$
be a subgroup of $\Group$.
The set of $h$ elements
$ \{ c,  c b_2,  c b_3, c b_{4}, \cdots\}$,
$ c \in \Group$ but not in $H$, is called left \emph{coset} $c H$. For a
given subgroup $H$ the group elements are partitioned into $H$ and $m-1$
cosets, where $m= |\Group|/|H|$.
}
    \end{quote}

There are a $2\cl{}$ left cosets of subgroup $H(\cl{})$ in $\Dn{\infty}$
\refeq{H(n)cosets}, with the quotient group $\Dn{\infty}/H(\cl{})$
isomorphic to the dihedral group $\Dn{\cl{}}$.

There are $\cl{}$ infinite dihedral $H(\cl{},k)$ subgroups  of
$\Dn{\infty}$, with $\cl{}$ left cosets  \refeq{H(n,k)cosets}
and the quotient group $\Dn{\infty}/H(\cl{},k)$
isomorphic to the cyclic group $\Cn{\cl{}}$.

A typical turbulent trajectory of
fluid flow has no symmetry beyond the identity, so its
symmetry group is the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$.

In summary:
You can visualize an {\lattstate}s invariant under a translation subgroup
$H(\mathbf{a})$, \reffig{fig:symmLattStates}\,(a), as a tiling of the
lattice $\integers$ by a {\lattstate} tiles with a fish painted on it,
swimming upstream, and no reflection symmetry.

Note that as $H(10,9)$ and $H(10,0)$ are not conjugate subgroups,
there is no translation or reflection that maps {\lattstate} of the first type
into {\lattstate} of the second.

An {\orbit} is by construction a {\em symmetry invariant} notion: as
the set of all {\lattstate}s that can be reached $\Xx$ by symmetries,
it is an invariant set, as any group action merely permutes it.
The full \statesp\ $\pS$ is a union of such orbits.

If $\Group$ is a symmetry, intrinsic properties of
an {\orbit} $p$ (period, Floquet multipliers) evaluated
anywhere along its $\Group$-orbit are the same.

A symmetry thus reduces the number of inequivalent {\lattstate}s $\pS_p$. So
we also need to describe the symmetry of a \emph{solution}, as opposed to
%\refeq{dscr:L-inv},
the symmetry of the \emph{system}.
%We start by
%defining the notions of \emph{\reducedsp}, of \emph{isotropy} of a
%{\statesp} point, and of the \emph{symmetry of an orbit}.

A generic orbit might be ergodic, unstable
and essentially uncontrollable. The ChaosBook strategy is
to populate the \statesp\ by a hierarchy of orbits which are
\emph{compact invariant sets} (\eqva, \po s, invariant tori, $\dots$),
each computable in a finite time.
They are  to
a generic orbit what fractions are to
normal numbers on the unit interval.

While for the infinite lattice case there are no `long axes', `short
axes', an even index $2k$ reflection $\Refl_{2k}$ still reflects the
lattice across the  $k$th lattice site (a `vertex' of a triangle or a
square in the finite example), while an odd index $2k-1$ reflection
$\Refl_{2k-1}$ reflects the lattice across the midpoint between sites  $k-1$
and $k$ (an `edge' of a square in the finite example).
\HL{2021-08-13}{This is correct only when we define that $\Refl$ is
the reflection across the $0$th lattice site.}

%    \PC{2021-08-22} {
Not sure we need this, so I dropped it for now: ``
For odd $\cl{}$, there are $(\cl{}-1)/2$ such classes.
For even $\cl{}$, there are $(\cl{}-2)/2$ such pairs, with the rotation
by half a circle a class  $\{\shift_{\cl{}/2}\}$ by itself. ''
%   }

    Dihedral groups are \emph{ambivalent }groups -- every element is
conjugate to its inverse. Thus, all the irreducible representations of a
dihedral group over the complex numbers can be realized over the real
numbers. Etc.
%    }


As \Dn{n} elements are combinations of one-step translations and reflections,
its group presentation is
\beq
  \Dn{n} = \left\langle {\shift, \Refl} \mid \shift^n = \Refl^2 = 1 ,
                        \shift\Refl= \Refl \shift^{n-1}
            \right\rangle
\,.
\ee{D_nPrsntation}
A presentation of the \emph{infinite dihedral group}\rf{KiLePa03} is
\beq
\Dn{\infty} = \left\langle {\shift, \Refl} \mid
            \Refl \shift\Refl= \shift^{-1}, \Refl^2 = 1
              \right\rangle
\,.
\ee{D_infty}


\Dn{1}, \Dn{2},
\Dn{3}, \Dn{4}, ...

Examples are the \Dn{3} Cayley \reftab{tab:D3multTab}
and the \Dn{6} Cayley \reftab{tab:D6multTab}.

So far, ChaosBook works out zeta function factorizations for \Dn{1}
(\refexam{exam:Symm1d}),    % was (\refsect{s-C-2-fact}),
\Dn{2} (known as
\HREF{https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Klein_four-group}{Klein
four-group}),
\Dn{3} (symmetric group $S_3$), and \Dn{4}.
% but somehow I get confused by all the invariant subspaces of solutions
% for \Dn{n}.

\section{Temporal lattice systems}
\label{sect:temp}

\subsection{Temporal Bernoulli system}
\label{LC21:Bernoulli}

To motivate our formulation of a \spt\ chaotic field theory to be
developed in the sequel\rf{CL18}, we recast the local initial value, time-evolution
Bernoulli map problem as a \emph{temporal lattice} fixed point condition,
the problem of enumerating and determining all global solutions.

`Temporal' here refers to the state (field) $\ssp_\zeit$, and the winding
number (source) $\Ssym{\zeit}$ taking their values on the lattice sites
of a 1\dmn\ \emph{temporal} integer lattice $\zeit\in\integers$. Over a
finite lattice segment, these can be written compactly  as a
\emph{\lattstate} and the corresponding \emph{symbol \brick}
\beq
\transp{\Xx} % = \{\ssp_j\}
             = (\ssp_{\zeit+1},\cdots,\ssp_{\zeit+\cl{}})
\,,\quad
\transp{\Mm} % = \{\Ssym{j}\}
             = (\Ssym{{\zeit+1}},\cdots,\Ssym{{\zeit+\cl{}}})
\,,
\ee{LC21:pathBern}
where $\transp{(\cdots)}$ denotes a transpose.
The Bernoulli equation,
% \refeq{LC21:circ-m},
rewritten as a first-order
difference equation
\beq
\ssp_{\zeit} - {s}\ssp_{\zeit-1} = - \Ssym{\zeit}
\,,\qquad  \ssp_{\zeit} \in [0,1)
\,,
\ee{LC21:1stepDiffEq}
takes the matrix form
\beq
\jMorb\,\Xx = - \Mm
\,,\qquad
\jMorb = \id-{s}{\shift}^{-1}
% former \ee{tempBernFix}
\,,
\ee{LC21:tempBern}
where the $[\cl{}\!\times\!\cl{}]$ matrix
\beq
\shift_{jk}=\delta_{j+1,k}
\,,\qquad
\shift
=  \left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
             0    &  1    &        &   &  \cr
                  &  0    &   1    &   &  \cr
                  &       &        & \ddots &  \cr
                  &       &        & 0 & 1 \cr
             1    &       &        &   & 0
          \end{array} \right)
\,,
\ee{LC21:hopMatrix}
implements the shift operation,
%\refeq{LC21:shiftBern},
a cyclic permutation
that translates forward in time the {\lattstate} $\Xx$ by one site,
$\transp{(\shift \Xx)}=(\ssp_2,\ssp_3,\cdots,\ssp_\cl{},\ssp_1)$. The
time evolution law
% \refeq{LC21:circ-m}
must be of the same form for all times,
so the {\shiftOp} $\shift$ has to be time-translation invariant, with
$\shift_{\cl{}+1,\cl{}}=\shift_{1\cl{}}=1$ matrix element enforcing the
periodicity. After $\cl{}$ shifts, a {\lattstate} returns to the initial
state,
\beq
\shift^\cl{}=\id
\,.
\ee{LC21:shift2n}

\subsection{\tempLatt}
\label{LC21:catLagrange}

Written out as a second-order difference equation, the \PV\ map
% \refeq{LC21:StateSpCatMap}
takes a particularly elegant, {\em \templatt}
form
\beq
\ssp_{\zeit+1}  -  s \, \ssp_{\zeit} + \ssp_{\zeit-1}
    =
-\Ssym{\zeit}
\,,
\ee{LC21:catMapNewt}
or,
in terms of a {{\lattstate}} $\Xx$, the corresponding {symbol \brick}
$\Mm$ \refeq{LC21:pathBern}, and the $[\cl{}\!\times\!\cl{}]$ {\shiftOp}
$\shift$ \refeq{LC21:hopMatrix},
\beq
(\shift - s\id + \shift^{-1})\,\Xx = -\Mm
\,,
\ee{LC21:catTempLatt}
very much like the {temporal Bernoulli} condition \refeq{LC21:tempBern}.
`Temporal' again refers to the global {\lattstate} (field) $\Xx$, and
the winding numbers (sources) $\Mm$ taking their values on the lattice
sites of a 1\dmn\ \emph{temporal} lattice $\zeit\in\integers$.

where
the $[\cl{}\!\times\!\cl{}]$ {\jacobianOrb} $\jMorb$ is now given by
\beq
\jMorb = \shift - s\id + \shift^{-1}
% \,.
\ee{LC21:tempCatFix}
a tri-diagonal Toeplitz matrix (constant along each diagonal,
$\jMorb_{k\ell} = j_{k-\ell}$) of circulant form,
\beq
\jMorb %  = \shift - s\id + \shift^{-1}
  =
\left(\begin{array}{ccccccc}
 -{s}& 1 & \cdot & \cdot &\dots & \cdot & 1 \\
 1 &  -{s}& 1 & \cdot &\dots & \cdot & \cdot \\
 \cdot & 1 &  -{s}& 1 &\dots & \cdot & \cdot \\
\vdots & \vdots &\vdots & \vdots & \ddots &\vdots &\vdots\\
 \cdot & \cdot & \dots &\dots &\dots  & -{s}& 1 \\
 1 & \cdot & \dots &  \dots &\dots& 1 &  -{s}
        \end{array} \right)
\,.
\ee{LC21:Hessian}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{{\Lattstate}s}
\label{s:lattState}

A {\lattstate} $\Xx$ is \emph{periodic} if it satisfies
\beq
\Xx({x} + {R}) = \Xx({x})
\ee{1DprimePO}
for any discrete translation
\(
{R} =n\mathbf{a}
\in \lattice
\,,
\)
where $n$ is any integer, and $\mathbf{a}$ is the integer lattice vector
that defines the \emph{Bravais cell} (or, the Bravais sublattice of
$\integers$).

The basic `atom' of a reflection-symmetric period $\cl{}$ {\lattstate} is
a `half' of it, the length ${m}$ orbit, and its reflection
\beq
\tilde{\Xx}      = \ssp_1 \ssp_2 \ssp_3 \cdots \ssp_{m}
\,,\qquad
\Refl\tilde{\Xx} = \ssp_{m} \cdots \ssp_3 \ssp_2 \ssp_1
\,,
\ee{gr:primeLattStat}
in terms of which a Bravais {\lattstate} \Xx\ has one of the
four symmetries:
\bea
(1) &&
{\tilde{\Xx}}
        \qquad\qquad\qquad  m=\cl{}
\label{reflSymNo(1)}\\
(2) &&
{\sitebox{\ssp_0} \tilde{\Xx} | \Refl\tilde{\Xx}}
        \qquad\quad\,       m=(\cl{}-1)/2\,,\quad n \mbox{ odd}
\label{reflSymOdd(2)}\\
(3) &&
{\sitebox{\ssp_0} \tilde{\Xx}
        \sitebox{\ssp_{m+1}} \Refl\tilde{\Xx}}
        \;\;\,              m=(\cl{}-2)/2\,,\quad n \mbox{ even}
\label{reflSymEvens0(3)}\\
(4) &&
{\tilde{\Xx} | \Refl\tilde{\Xx} |}
        \qquad\qquad        m=\cl{}/2\,,\quad n \mbox{ even}
\label{reflSymEvens1(4)}
\eea


While the defining equation for \templatt\ or \henlatt\ is {equivariant} under the integer
lattice \emph{space group} $p1m$ symmetry operations, the individual
{\lattstate}s either have no symmetry at all (they are, after all,
`turbulent'), or are invariant under subgroups of space group $p1m$.

In addition, the \templatt\ (but not the \henlatt) has a \emph{dynamical
symmetry} under the inversion $S$ through the center of the
\(0\leq\ssp_j<1\) unit interval,
\beq
\bar{\ssp}_j = S\ssp_j = 1-\ssp_j
\,,\quad \mbox{ for all } j\in \lattice
\,.
\ee{catFieldInv}
 Indeed,
if ${\Xx}_{\Mm}=\{\ssp_{\zeit}\}$ is a {\lattstate}, its conjugation
symmetry partner ${\bar{\Xx}}=\{1-\ssp_{\zeit}\}$ is also a {\lattstate}. So, every {\lattstate} either belongs to a conjugate pair
$\{{\Xx},\bar{\Xx}\}$, or is self-dual under conjugation.

The \templatt\
happens to involve two quite distinct lattices:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(i)]
In the latticization of a continuous time, one replaces a
time-dependent field $\ssp(\zeit)$ at time
$\zeit\in\reals^d$ by a discrete set of
its values $\ssp_\zeit=\ssp(\zeit\Delta{T})$  on lattice sites,
where the subscript $\zeit\in\integers$ is a discrete
time \emph{coordinate}.
  \item[(ii)]
A peculiarity of the \templatt\ is that the \emph{field} $\ssp_{\zeit}$
is confined to the unit interval $[0,1)$, imparting a
$\integers$ lattice structure onto
the calculationally intermediate {\fundPip} $\jMorb$ basis vectors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reflection-symmetric {\lattstate}s}
\label{s:ReflLattState}

\begin{description}
    \PCpost{2021-08-14}{\PCedit{
Almost everything in this section is misguided or wrong.
Delete eventually...
                }}
\end{description}

%
Consider a {\lattstate}
\beq
\cdots \ssp_{-3} \ssp_{-2} \ssp_{-1} \ssp_{0}
      \ssp_{1} \ssp_{2} \ssp_{3} \ssp_{4}  \cdots
\ee{latticeInf}
over an infinite 1\dmn\ integer lattice $\integers$.
Assume for the moment that the system is linear so a sum of {\lattstate}s is
also a {\lattstate}.

If the {\lattstate} is antisymmetric under an even reflection, the
antisymmetric subspace is 2\dmn. The {\lattstate} tiles the infinite
lattice as:
\beq
\cycle{\sitebox{0}\,\ssp_1 \ssp_2 \,  \sitebox{0}
\,\underline{\ssp_2}\,\underline{\ssp_1} }
\,,
\ee{antisymmD6s0}

Go to any lattice site $k$, reflect the {\lattstate} and average the two,
using the translate-reflect operator
    \PC{2021-10-08}{
Was 'shift-reflect', but Burak says in fluid dynamics translation is one
direction, but `reflect' is in a transverse direction; changed to avoid
confusion.
    }
\beq
\PP_{{k}}
           = \frac{1}{2} (\unit+\Refl_{k})
           \,.
\ee{reflProj-k}
The result is a {\lattstate} reflection-symmetric across lattice site
$k$. From \refeq{D_nConj} it follows that for  odd $k$, all $\PP_{{k}}$
 operators are in the same conjugacy class as $\PP_{1}$, and
for even $k$, all $\PP_{{k}}$ are in the same conjugacy class as
$\PP_{0}$. It suffices to do the computation only once for each class.

The determinant of a $[3\times3]$ matrix can be written as the

where $A$ is the antisymmetrization projection operator,
and $3$ is the dimension of the matrix $M$.
Evaluating this seems a bit not smart...



Apply the \refeq{reflProj-k} operator
\(
\PP_{{0}} = (\unit+\Refl)/2
\)
to {\lattstate} \refeq{latticeInf}. We obtain
a {\lattstate}
\beq

where

\)
are pairwise symmetric under the reflection $\Refl$, with
\(
\sitebox{\tilde{\ssp}_0} =(\ssp_0+\ssp_0)/2
\)
indicating that the field at the lattice site $0$ is
unchanged by reflection.


Next apply the projection operator
\(
\PP_{{1}} = (\unit+\Refl\shift)/2
\)
from \refeq{reflProj-k}
to a {\lattstate} \refeq{latticeInf}. We obtain
a {\lattstate}
\beq
\cdots \tilde{\ssp}_{4} \tilde{\ssp}_{3} \tilde{\ssp}_{2} \tilde{\ssp}_{1} |
      \tilde{\ssp}_{1} \tilde{\ssp}_{2} \tilde{\ssp}_{3} \tilde{\ssp}_{4}  \cdots
\,,
\ee{latticeInf1}
where
\(
|
\)
indicates that the state is symmetric under reflection across midpoint
between lattice sites $0$ and $1$, and the successive lattice pair
averages
\(
\tilde{\ssp}_{j} =(\ssp_{j}+\ssp_{1-j})/2
\,,\;
j=1,2,3,\cdots\,,
\)
are pairwise symmetric under the reflection $\Refl_{1}$.

In summary, as reflection operators $\Refl_{0}=\Refl$ and
$\Refl_{1}=\Refl\shift$ belong to the two dihedral group $\Dn{\infty}$
classes, all other {\lattstate}s symmetric with respect to
reflection $\Refl_{k}$, for any  integer $k$, are conjugate to the above
two types of symmetric {\lattstate}s.

\begin{description}

    \PCpost {2021-08-23}{
    I still worry about the antisymmetric states \refeq{HLantisymmD6s1},
    \refeq{HLantisymmD6s0}; here \refeq{antisymmD6s1} and
    \refeq{antisymmD6s1} look wrong as they force
    the fixed lattice site fields to be zero. Cannot be true for
    nonlinear field theories, such as \henlatt.
     Presumably, individual symmetric
    {\lattstate}s are either symmetric or antisymmetric under the swap,
    not just the reflection-reduced {\jacobianOrb} $\jMorb$. I wish
    someone would actually show me how this works for individual
    \templatt\ or \henlatt\ {\lattstate}s? I'll plod on...
    }

\item[2021-08-28 Predrag]
For example, if the period of the {\lattstate}s is 6, we have two kinds
of reflections. If the {\lattstate} is antisymmetric under an odd
reflection, the antisymmetric subspace is 3\dmn,
and the Bravais {\lattstate} tiles \lattice\ as:
\beq
\cycle{\ssp_1 \ssp_2 \ssp_3 |
\underline{\ssp_3}\,\underline{\ssp_2}\,\underline{\ssp_1} |}
\,,
\ee{antisymmD6s1}
where the underline is a shorthand for
\(
\underline{\ssp_j}= - \ssp_j
\,.
\)

    \item[2021-08-29 Predrag]
A period-5 reflection \emph{antisymmetric {\lattstate}} tiles the infinite
lattice as:
\beq
\cdots
\underline{\ssp_2}\,\underline{\ssp_1}
    \,\sitebox{\ssp_0}\,
\ssp_1 \ssp_2
    \,|\,
\underline{\ssp_2}\,\underline{\ssp_1}
    \,\sitebox{\ssp_0}\,
\ssp_1 \ssp_2
    \,|\,
\cdots
\,,
\ee{PCantisymmD5}
The thing to get used to is that a reflection of the Bravais cell
leads to
\[
  \Refl\,\cycle{\sitebox{\ssp_0}\,
\ssp_1 \ssp_2
    \,|\,
\underline{\ssp_2}\,\underline{\ssp_1}}
   =
\cycle{\sitebox{\ssp_0}\,
\underline{\ssp_1}\,\underline{\ssp_2}
    \,|\,
\ssp_2 \ssp_1  }
\,,
\]
which is not a translation; length-2
{\brick} $(\ssp_1,\ssp_2)$ lattice fields have changed signs.
I assume that is OK because the overall number of `-'s does not change.
\[
\begin{aligned}
-{s}_0\ssp_0  = -m_0 \\
\ssp_0 -{s}_2\ssp_1 +\ssp_2 = -m_1 \\
\ssp_1 -({s}_3+1) \ssp_2 = -m_2
\end{aligned}
\,.
\]
Note, this differs from \refeq{HLantisymmD6s0}, where
it is assumed that the antisymmetry forces $\ssp_0=0$ (which
is indeed the case for a multiplicative symmetrization operator
with eigenvalue -1, but we are not doing that here, I think).

{\jacobianOrb}
\bea
\jMorb_- &=&
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
-{s}_0 & 0 & 0 \\
 1 &-{s}_1 & 1 \\
 0 & 1 &-{s}_2-1
\end{array}\right)
\mbox{ or }
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-{s}_1 & 1 \\
  1 &-{s}_2-1
\end{array}\right)
    \continue
\Det\jMorb_-  &=&
-{s}_0({s}_1{s}_2+{s}_2-1)
\label{PCantisymmOrbJacD5}
\eea
where the $[2\times2]$ matrix comes from assuming that separately fixed.

As \templatt\ fields are always presented mod 1, there the asymmetric
states do not look asymmetric. That would be much easier to see in plots
of {\henlatt}  {\lattstate}s of \reftab{tab:HenCycD5} and
\reffig{fig:EG05aCyc5}.

For ${s}_j=3$ the determinant of this \jacobianOrb\ is 3*11 or 11. Are
there 11 antisymmetric {\lattstate}s, \ie, the corresponding 2
antisymmetric  5-orbits? I assume $\ssp_j=0$ fixed point counts as
`antisymmetric'. Seems to agree with \reftab{tab:Bmack93Fixed}.

Starting with the {\brick} $(\ssp_2,\ssp_1)$, followed by
$\sitebox{\ssp_0}$ presumably results in a time-reversed {\jacobianOrb}
$\Refl\jMorb\Refl$.
From this construction it is not clear how to connect this
to the 5\dmn\ Bravais cell; so, see also \refeq{symmCycD5Refl}, and the
continuation in \refeq{HLreflectionSymOdd}.

\section{A Lind zeta function for flip systems}
\label{sect:dihedralZeta}

Let $\Group$ be a group, $\pS$ a set and $\map: \Group \times \pS \to \pS$
a $\Group$-action on $\pS$.
The Lind zeta function\rf{Lind96} is defined by
\beq
\zeta_{Lind}(t) =
\exp \left( \sum_{H} \;
            \frac{N_{H}}{|\Group/{H}|}t^{|\Group/H|}
      \right)
\,,
\ee{Ryu17eq:1.3}
where the sum is over all finite-index subgroups $H$ of $\Group$,
such that $|G/H| < \infty$, and $N_{H}$ is defined by
(see \refeq{Ryu17eq:3.0A}):
\beq
N_{H} = |\{\ssp \in \pS : \mbox{ all } h \in H \quad \map(h,\ssp) = \ssp\}|.
\ee{Ryu17eq:1.3A}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A flip system $(\pS, \map, \Refl)$ is a dynamical system, where $\pS$ is a topological
space and $\map: \pS \to \pS$ is a homeomorphism.
$\Refl: \pS \to \pS$ is flip for $(\pS, \map)$
that satisfy:
\beq
\Refl\circ\map\circ\Refl = \map^{-1}
\quad \text{and} \quad
\Refl^2 = {\bf 1}
\,.
\ee{KiLePa03Flip}
Kim \etal\rf{KiLePa03} showed that the zeta function $\zeta_{\Refl}$ of a
flip system $(\pS, \map, \Refl)$ can be defined as
a Lind zeta function $\zeta_{Lind}$ of the
$\Dn{\infty}$-action $\map: \Dn{\infty} \times \pS \to \pS$ that is
given by:
\beq
\map(r, x) = \map(x)
\quad \text{and} \quad
\map(\Refl, x) = \Refl(x)
\,.
\ee{KiLePa03eq:1.5}

Every finite index subgroup of the {infinite dihedral group} $\Dn{\infty}$
is either
\beq
H(\cl{}) = \langle \shift^\cl{} \rangle
    \qquad \text{or} \qquad
H(\cl{},k) = \langle \shift^\cl{}, \shift^k \Refl \rangle \, ,
\ee{KiLePa03H(i,j)}
with indices
\beq
|\Dn{\infty}/H(\cl{})| =  2|\cl{}|
    \qquad \text{or} \qquad
|\Dn{\infty}/H(\cl{},k)| = |\cl{}|
\,.
\ee{KiLePa03Index}
\HL{2021-07-16}{
The infinite dihedral group \Dn{\infty} is the point group of a 1\dmn\
Bravais lattice.\\
The subgroup $H(n)$ is a translation group of a sublattice of the 1\dmn\
Bravais lattice.\\
The subgroup $H(n,k)$ is the symmetry group of a 1\dmn\ lattice with a
picture in the unit cell that is invariant under $\Refl_k=\Refl r^k$.\\
}

If $\cl{}$ is a positive integer and $k$ is an integer, then $N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k}$
will denote the number of points in $\pS$ fixed by $\map^\cl{}$ and
$\map^k\circ\Refl$:
    \PC{2021-07-04, 2021-08-25}{our notation, replaced subscript
                    ${}_{\map,\Refl}$ by noting.} %superscript ${}^{\Refl}$.}
\beq
N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k} = |\{\ssp \in \pS :
            \map^\cl{} (\ssp) = \map^k\circ\Refl(\ssp) = \ssp\}|
\,.
\ee{Ryu17eq:3.0A}
They obtain
    \PC{2021-07-04}{my own notation, replaced subscript
                    ${}_{\map,\Refl}$ by superscript ${}^{\Refl}$.}
\beq
%\zeta_{\map,\Refl}(t) =
\zeta_{\Refl}(t) =
\exp \Big(\sum_{\cl{}=1}^{\infty} \, \frac{N_{\cl{}}}{2\cl{}}t^{2\cl{}}
          +\sum_{\cl{}=1}^{\infty} \, \sum_{k=0}^{\cl{}-1}\,
                     \frac{N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k}}{\cl{}}t^{\cl{}} \Big)
\,.
\ee{Ryu17eq:3.0B}
The first sum factors as an {Artin-Mazur} zeta func\-tion
\refeq{ArtMaz5}:  % was {Ryu17eq:2.1A}
\beq
\exp \left(\sum_{\cl{}=1}^\infty
\frac{t^{2\cl{}}}{2\cl{}} N_\cl{}
         \right)
= \sqrt{\zeta_{top}(t^2)}
\ee{Ryu17eq:2.1B}
The definition of a flip \refeq{Ryu17eq:3.0A} tells us that
\beq
N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k} = N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k+\cl{}} = N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k+2}
\ee{Ryu17eq:3.0C}
and this implies
\beq
N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k} =
    \begin{cases}
\, N^{\Refl}_{\cl{}, 0} \qquad \text{ if } \cl{} \text{ is odd}, \\
\, N^{\Refl}_{\cl{}, 0} \qquad \text{ if } \cl{} \text{ and } k \text{ are even}, \\
\, N^{\Refl}_{\cl{}, 1} \qquad \text{ if } \cl{} \text{ is even and } k \text{ is odd}
\,.
    \end{cases}
\ee{Ryu17eq:3.0D}
Hence
\HL{2021-07-07}{
To understand $N_{\cl{},k} = N_{\cl{},k+2}$:
Note that $r H_{\cl{},k} r^{-1} = H_{\cl{},k+2}$. Let $x$
be a periodic point that is fixed by group $H_{\cl{},k}$:
\[
h \cdot x = x, \, \forall h \in H_{\cl{},k} \, .
\]
For simplicity here I denote $\map(h,x)$ as $h \cdot x$.
There is a periodic point $r \cdot x$ that is
fixed by group $H_{\cl{},k+2} = \shift H_{\cl{},k} \shift^{-1}$:
\[
\shift h\shift^{-1} \, \shift \cdot x = \shift h \cdot x = \shift \cdot x , \, \forall h \in H_{\cl{},k} \, .
\]
So the numbers of periodic points fixed by group $H_{\cl{},k}$
and $H_{\cl{},k+2}$ are equal.
}
\beq
\sum_{k=0}^{\cl{}-1} \, \frac{N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k}}{\cl{}}
=   \begin{cases}
\, N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},0} \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad
                            \text{if } \cl{} \text{ is odd}
\,,\\ \\ \,
\displaystyle{\frac{N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},0}+N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},1}}{2} \qquad
                            \text{if } \cl{} \text{ is even}\,.}
    \end{cases}
\ee{Ryu17eq:3.0E}
so the Lind zeta function of the flip triple system $(\pS,\map,\Refl)$ is
\beq
\zeta_{\Refl}(t) = \sqrt{\zeta_{top}(t^2)} \; e^{h(t)},
\ee{Ryu17eq:2.1}
where $\zeta_{top}$ is the
Artin-Mazur zeta function \refeq{ArtMaz5},  % was {Ryu17eq:2.1A} %{Isola90-13c},
and the counts of symmetric orbits
\beq
h(t) = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \left\{
       N^{\Refl}_{2m-1, 0}\,t^{2m-1}
       + \left(N^{\Refl}_{2m,0}+N^{\Refl}_{2m,1}\right)\,\frac{ t^{2m}}{2}
                               \right\}
\,.
\ee{Ryu17eq:2.11}
they call the ``generating function.''

The $\exp(h(t))$ in \refeq{Ryu17eq:2.1} can be factored into terms that
presumably correspond --in the particular, \Henon\ case-- to the
$D_\cl{}N_\cl{}$ factors in \refeq{EGfactorS}, but this is now totally
general, in the spirit of \reftab{tab:Bmack93Fixed}, for
any time-reversal discrete time dynamical system. Should be generalizable
also to systems with continuous time.

The zeta function $\zeta_{\Refl}$ can be written as a product over
{\orbit}s. Let $O_1$ be the collection of finite orbits with time
reversal (flip) symmetry, and $O_2$ be the collection of the pairs of
orbits without time reversal symmetry, each an orbit and the flipped
orbit. A finite \orbit\ $p$ is a periodic points set
\[
p = \{\ssp, \map(\ssp), \dots, \map^{\cl{p}-1}(\ssp)\}
\]
if $p \in O_1$, and
\[
p = \{\ssp, \map(\ssp), \dots, \map^{k-1}(\ssp)\} \cup
\{\Refl(\ssp), \map\circ\Refl(\ssp), \dots, \map^{k-1}\circ\Refl(\ssp)\}
\]
if $p \in O_2$, where $k=\cl{p}/2$.

If $p \in O_1$,
\beq
\zeta_{p}(t) =
\sqrt{\frac{1}{1-t^{2\cl{p}}}}\exp\left(\frac{t^{\cl{p}}}{1-t^{\cl{p}}}\right)
\,,
\ee{KiLePa03ZetaO1}
and if $p \in O_2$,
\beq
\zeta_{p}(t) =
\frac{1}{1-t^{\cl{p}}}
\,.
\ee{KiLePa03ZetaO2}
The product form of the zeta function is:
\beq
1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t) =
\sqrt{\prod_{p_1\in {O_1}}(1-t^{2\cl{p_1}})}
      \;\exp\left(-\frac{t^{\cl{p_1}}}{1-t^{\cl{p_1}}}\right)
\prod_{p_2\in O_2} (1-t^{\cl{p_2}})
\,.
\ee{KiLePa03ZetaProd}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Counting {\lattstate}s}
\label{sect:PeriodicPsCount}

Given the topological zeta function \refeq{Ryu17eq:3.0B} we can count the
number of fixed points from the generating function:
\beq
\frac{-t\frac{d}{dt}(1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t))}{1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t)}
= \sum_{\cl{}=1}^\infty N_\cl{}t^{2\cl{}}
+ \sum_{\cl{}=1}^\infty\sum_{k=0}^{\cl{}-1}N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k}t^{\cl{}}
= \sum_{m=1}^\infty a_m t^m \, ,
\ee{zetatopGenerating}
where the coefficients are:
\beq
a_m =
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} N_{m,k}^{\Refl}
= m N_{m,0}^{\Refl}
\, ,
\quad & \text{$m$ is odd}
 \, ,\\
&N_{m/2} + \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} N_{m,k}^{\Refl}
= N_{m/2} + \frac{m}{2} \left(N_{m,0}^{\Refl} + N_{m,1}^{\Refl}\right)
\, ,
\quad & \text{$m$ is even}
  \, .
 \end{aligned}\right.
\ee{zetatopCoefficients}
Using the product formula of topological zeta function \refeq{KiLePa03ZetaProd} and
the numbers of orbits with length up to 5 from the \reftab{tab:Bmack93Fixed},
we can write the topological zeta function:
\bea
1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t) &=&
\sqrt{1-t^2} \exp\left(-\frac{t}{1-t}\right) (1-t^4) \exp\left(-\frac{2t^2}{1-t^2}\right)
\left(\sqrt{1-t^6}\right)^3 \continue
&& \exp\left(-\frac{3t^3}{1-t^3}\right)(1-t^6)(1-t^8)^3
\exp\left(-\frac{6t^4}{1-t^4}\right) \continue
&& (1-t^8)^2(1-t^{10})^5\exp\left(-\frac{10t^5}{1-t^5}\right)
(1-t^{10})^6 \dots \, .
\eea
The generating function is:
\bea
\frac{-t\frac{d}{dt}(1/\zeta_{\Refl})}{1/\zeta_{\Refl}}
=
t + 7t^2 + 12t^3 + 41t^4 + 55t^5 + \dots \, ,
\eea
which is in agreement with \refeq{zetatopCoefficients}, where the $N_\cl{}$ and $N_{\cl{}}^{\Refl}$
are the $C_\cl{}$ and $SF_\cl{}$ in the \reftab{tab:Bmack93Fixed}.

We are not able to retrieve the numbers of fixed points by their symmetry groups using this topological
zeta function \refeq{Ryu17eq:3.0B}, unless we rewrite the topological zeta function with two variables:
\beq
\zeta_{\Refl}(t,u) =
\exp \Big(\sum_{\cl{}=1}^{\infty} \, \frac{N_{\cl{}}}{2\cl{}}t^{2\cl{}}
          +\sum_{\cl{}=1}^{\infty} \, \sum_{k=0}^{\cl{}-1}\,
                     \frac{N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k}}{\cl{}}u^{\cl{}} \Big)
\,.
\ee{FlipZetaTU}
Using this topological zeta function $\zeta_{\Refl}(t,u)$ we can write two generating functions:
\beq
\frac{-t\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t,u))}{1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t,u)}
= \sum_{\cl{}=1}^\infty N_\cl{}t^{2\cl{}}
\, ,
\ee{zetatopGeneratingT}
and
\beq
\frac{-u\frac{\partial}{\partial u}(1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t,u))}{1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t,u)}
= \sum_{\cl{}=1}^\infty\sum_{k=0}^{\cl{}-1}N^{\Refl}_{\cl{},k}u^{\cl{}}
\, .
\ee{zetatopGeneratingU}
Using the product formula of this topological zeta function and the numbers of orbits with length
up to 5 from the \reftab{tab:Bmack93Fixed}, the topological zeta function is:
\bea
1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t,u) &=&
\sqrt{1-t^2} \exp\left(-\frac{u}{1-u}\right) (1-t^4) \exp\left(-\frac{2u^2}{1-u^2}\right)
\left(\sqrt{1-t^6}\right)^3 \continue
&& \exp\left(-\frac{3u^3}{1-u^3}\right)(1-t^6)(1-t^8)^3
\exp\left(-\frac{6u^4}{1-u^4}\right) \continue
&& (1-t^8)^2(1-t^{10})^5\exp\left(-\frac{10u^5}{1-u^5}\right)
(1-t^{10})^6 \dots \, .
\eea
And the generating function from this topological zeta function is:
\bea
\frac{-u\frac{\partial}{\partial u}(1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t,u))}{1/\zeta_{\Refl}(t,u)}
=
u + 6u^2 + 12u^3 + 36u^4 + 55u^5 + \dots \, ,
\eea
which is in agreement with \refeq{zetatopGeneratingU}, where the $N_{\cl{}}^{\Refl}$ is the $SF_{\cl{}}$
in the \reftab{tab:Bmack93Fixed}.

\section{Permutation representations}
\label{sect:dihedralMatReps}

Burnside's {\em Table of marks}, whose rows are the orbit types, and the
columns are the subgroups seems related to ChaosBook determinant
factorizations.

\HREF{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside_ring\#Marks}{Marks wiki}:
Much as character theory simplifies working with group representations,
`marks' simplify working with  permutation representations and the Burnside ring
(for the \Dn{3} example, see \refeq{HL-D3BurnsideRing}).

See also
\HREF{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/table+of+marks} {ncatlab {\em Table of marks}}.
Possibly \HREF{https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-11167-3}
{DOI} contains the tables we might want to use.

\HREF{https://www.gap-system.org}{GAP} is an amazing system for computational discrete algebra.
In particular, it computes
\HREF{https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap70.html}
     {{\em tables of marks}}.

\HREF{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside_ring\#Permutation_representations}
{Permutation representations wiki}:

Associated to a {\lattstate} \Xx\ is a vector space with the \Xx\ lattice sites
as the basis.  An action of a finite group \Group\ on \Xx\ induces a linear
action on this vector space, called a \emph{permutation representation}.

$H\subseteq\Group$ is a subgroup of \Group.

The table of marks of the group  \Group\ is computed from the \emph{lattice
of subgroups} of \Group.

The \emph{mark} of $H$ on $\Xx$ is the number of elements of $\Xx$ that are
fixed by every element of $H$:
$m_\Xx(H) = \left|\Xx^H\right|$,
where
\[\Xx^H = \{ x\in \Xx \mid h\cdot x = x, \forall h\in H\}
\,.
\]
If $H$ and $K$ are conjugate subgroups, then $m_\Xx(H) = m_\Xx(K)$ for any
finite $\Group$-set $\Xx$; indeed, if $K = gHg^{-1}$ then $\Xx^K = g\Xx^H$.

Let $\Group_1=\id$,
$\Group_2,\cdots,$
$\Group_N = \Group$
be representatives of the $N$ conjugacy classes of subgroups of \Group,
ordered in such a way that whenever $\Group_i$ is conjugate to a subgroup of
$\Group_j$, then $i\leq{j}$.  Now define the $[N\times{N}]$ table (square
matrix) whose ($i,j$)th entry is $m(\Group_i,\Group_j)$. This matrix is
lower triangular, and the elements on the diagonal are non-zero so it is
invertible.

The table of marks (Burnside matrix) entries are the number of elements in
the orbit $\Group/K$ fixed by the subgroup $H$.

The first column is the degree of the representation.
The bottom row is 1's because $\Group/\Group$ is a single point.
The diagonal terms are (CONTINUE) %m(H, H) = | NG(H)/H |.

\Dn{3} table of marks is given in \reftab{tab:D3marks}, and \Dn{6} table of
marks in \reftab{tab:D6marks}. Corresponding sets of {\lattstate}s are given
by {Burnside rings} \refeq{HL-D3BurnsideRing} and  \refeq{HL-D6BurnsideRing}

\paragraph{Theorem (Burnside 1897):}
If $\Xx$ is a $G$-set, and $u_i= m_\Xx(\Group_i)$ its row vector of marks,
then $\Xx$ decomposes as a disjoint union of $a_i$ copies of the
orbit of type $\Group_i$, where the vector $a$ satisfies \refeq{BurnsideTheorem}
\beq
{\bf a} M  =  {\bf u}
\,,
\ee{BurnsideTheo}
and $M$ is the matrix of the table of marks.

\item[2021-06-21 Predrag]
Character tables in physics and chemistry use the {\em Mulliken symbols} as
the representations names, such as $A_1$ or $T_{2g}$. Montaldi adheres to
that notation, except that he denotes the trivial representation by $A_0$
rather than $A_1$.

Montaldi \HREF{http://eprints.maths.manchester.ac.uk/1829/1/circulant.pdf} {{\em
Notes on circulant matrices}} (2012) are very pedagogical. He discusses (as
we do, calling this the permutation rep) the representation theory of
the cyclic group (or dihedral group in the symmetric case) acting on
$\reals^\cl{}$.

For each $\ell =1,...,[(\cl{}-1)/2]$ let
$A_{\ell}$ be the irreducible 1\dmn\ real representation of \Dn{\cl{}}: let
the rotation $r$ act by rotation through $2\pi\ell/\cl{}$ and let $s$ act by
a reflection (this is independent of the choice of reflection as any two
reflections are conjugate, and the resulting irreps equivalent).

Here $[q]$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $q$.

$A_{0}$ is the trivial rep and if $\cl{}$ is even, $A_\cl{}/2$ is the 1\dmn\
rep where $r$ and $s$ act by multiplication by -1. These irreducible
representations are also irreps for the cyclic group \Cn{\cl{}} (ignoring
$s$).
The real 1\dmn\ reps $E_r$ are irreducible but not absolutely irreducible,
and their complexification splits as a sum of two 1-d reps.

\paragraph{Proposition 1}
The above (permutation)  representation decomposes as a sum of irreps:
\beq
A_0 \oplus A_1 \cdots \oplus A_{\cl{}/2}
\ee{Montaldi12(4a)}
This is called the \emph{isotypic decomposition} of $\reals^\cl{}$ for this
action (or representation).

The eigenvectors of M are the same for any circulant matrix  M.
Define the vectors $u^{(\ell)},v^{(\ell)} \in \reals^\cl{}$, with components
\beq
u^{(\ell)}_j=\cos(2{\pi}j\ell/\cl{})
    \,,\qquad
v^{(\ell)}_j=\sin(2{\pi}j\ell/\cl{})
\,.
\ee{Montaldi12(1a)}
Note that
$u^{(\cl{}-\ell)} = u^{(\ell)}$ and
$v^{(\cl{}-\ell)} =-v^{(\ell)}$.
In particular, $v^{(0)}=0$ and if $\cl{}$ is even then $v^{(\cl{}/2)}=0$.
There is therefore a total of $\cl{}$  linearly independent vectors
\beq
u^{(\ell)}\;\;(\ell=0,...,\left[\frac{\cl{}}{2}\right])
\mbox{ and }
v^{(\ell)}\;\;(\ell=1,...,\left[\frac{\cl{}-1}{2}\right])
\,.
\ee{Montaldi12(1b)}
They form a basis for $\reals^\cl{}$
(there is more complex components detail in Montaldi notes).

In particular,
$u^{(0)}= \transp{(1,1\cdots,1)}$ and
$u^{(n/2)}=\transp{(1,-1,1...,-1)}$
(the latter if $\cl{}$ is even) are real eigenvectors.

\paragraph{Proposition 2}
The component $A_{\ell}$ is spanned by the vectors $u_{\ell},v_{\ell}$.

\paragraph{Proposition 3}
A matrix M is circulant iff it commutes with the action of \Cn{\cl{}}, and it
is symmetric and circulant iff it commutes with \Dn{\cl{}}.
$\lambda_0$ and (if $\cl{}$ is even) $\lambda_{\cl{}/2}$ are simple, while
the other $\lambda_{\ell}$ are double eigenvalues.

``[...] what is called in group theory a character of the group of

\begin{quote}
[...] the evaluation of Dirac and similar character operators is all that is
required for the solution of the standard molecular problems in the spirit of
Dirac's original program which avoids appeal to formal group theory.
\end{quote}

Dirac characters \refeq{DasguptaLct15b} use  not only  the  abstract  group  information,  but  also
account for the symmetry information contained in the basis  set  used. The
diagonalization  of  Dirac  characters has three main advantages:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
It can be realized by means of a quite simple and
 general algorithm.
  \item
The projective irreps obtained are just  the ones that  are
 needed  to  reduce  the  starting  basis set into irreducible sets.
  \item
No tabulated  quantities  are  required  to  construct the projective irreps.
\end{enumerate}

The  scheme  is  completely  general,  in  the  sense that  it  applies  to
all  space  groups.

\begin{description}

  \item[\student]  asks:
    {What are cosets good for?}{
Apologies for glossing over their meaning in the lecture. I try to
minimize group-theory jargon, but cosets cannot be ignored.

Dresselhaus \etal\rf{Dresselhaus07} \CBlibrary{Dresselhaus07}
Chapter~1 {\em Basic Mathematical Background: Introduction}
needs them to show that the dimension
of a subgroup is a divisor of the dimension of the group.
For example, \Cn{3} of dimension 3 is a subgroup
of \Dn{3} of dimension 6.

In
\toChaosBook{chapter.10}{\em Chapter 10. Flips, slides and turns}
cosets are absolutely essential.
The significance of the coset is that if a {\lattstate} has a symmetry, then
the elements in a coset act on the {\lattstate} the same way, and generate
all equivalent copies of this {\lattstate}.
Example~10.7. {\em Subgroups, cosets of \Dn{3}}
should help you understand that.

writes:
When talking about the cosets of a subgroup we demonstrated multiplication
between cosets with a specific example, but this wasn't leading to something
along the lines of that the set of all left cosets of a subgroup (or the set
of all the right cosets of a subgroup) form a group, correct? It didn't
appear so in the example since the ``unit''
\(
\{E,A\}
\)
we looked appears to only have the
properties of an identity with multiplication from one direction (the
direction depending on if it is the set of left cosets or the set of right
cosets). In the context of the lecture I think this point was related to
Lagrange's theorem (although we didn't call it that) and I vaguely remember
cosets being used in the proof of Lagrange's theorem but I wasn't connecting
it today. Are we going to cover that in a future lecture?

  \item[Predrag] %  2019-01-15
You are right - Lagrange's theorem (see the
\HREF{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange\%27s_theorem_(group_theory)}
{wiki}) simply says the order of a subgroup has to be a divisor of the order
of the group. We used cosets to partition elements of $G$ to prove that. But
what we really need cosets for is to define (see Dresselhaus
\etal\rf{Dresselhaus07} Sect.~1.7) {\em Factor Groups} whose elements are
cosets of a self-conjugate subgroup
\CBlibrary{Dresselhaus07}. I will
not cover that in a subsequent lecture, so please read up on it yourself.

  \item[\student] % 2017-08-31 Michael Meehan
You talked about the period of an element $X$, and said that that \emph{period}
is the \emph{set}
\beq
\{E,X, \cdots, X^{n-1}\}
\,,
\ee{Xorbit}
where $n$ is the \emph{order} of the element $X$. I had thought that set was the
subgroup generated by the element $X$ and that the period of the element $X$
was a synonym for the order of the element $X$? Is that incorrect?

To keep things as simple as possible, in Thursday's lecture I followed
Sect.~1.3 {\em Basic Definitions} of Dresselhaus \etal\
textbook\rf{Dresselhaus07}, to the letter.
In Def.~3 the \emph{order} of an element $X$ is the smallest $n$
such that $X^n=E$, and they call the set \refeq{Xorbit} the \emph{period} of
$X$. I do not like that usage (and do not remember seeing it anywhere else).
As you would do, in ChaosBook.org
Chap.~\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/paper.shtml\#finiteGr} {\emph{Flips, slides
and turns}} I also define the smallest $n$ to be the \emph{period} of $X$ and
refer to the set \refeq{Xorbit} as the \emph{orbit} generated by $X$. When we
get to compact continuous groups, the orbit will be a (great) circle
generated by a given Lie algebra element, and look more like what we usually
think of as an orbit.

I am not using my own \wwwcb{} here, not to confuse things further by
discussing both time evolution and its discrete symmetries. Here we focus on
the discrete group only (typically spatial reflections and finite angle
rotations).

The symmetry is
\Cn{n}, and one needs to distinguish \Cn{n} orbits
(''{prime cycle}s'' in ChaosBook; one per each orbit).
The right way to do this is by going to
\Cn{n} irreps, ie, by the discrete Fourier transform, with all reciprocal
lattice Brillioun zone solutions {\orbit}s in an $1/n$ sliver of a
$n$-gon. If $n$ is prime, this is irreducible; if it is a multiple of a
prime, one should remove those solutions, as they have already been
accounted for.

The translation group $T$, the set of translations $\vec{t}$ that put the
crystallographic structure in coincidence with itself, constitutes the
\emph{lattice}. $T$ is a normal subgroup of \Group. It defines the
\emph{Bravais lattice}. In 1 dimension translations are of the form
\[
\vec{t} = \vec{t}_{\vec{n}} = n  \vec{a}
\,,\qquad
n\in \integers
\,.
\]
The basis vector $\vec{a}$ spans the \emph{unit cell}.
\index{unit cell}
The lattice unit cell is always a \emph{generating region} (a tile that tiles
the entire space), but the smallest generating region --\emph{the fundamental
domain}-- may be smaller than the lattice unit. At each lattice point the
identical group of ``atoms'' constitutes the \emph{motif}.
A \emph{primitive cell} is a minimal region repeated by lattice translations.
The lattice and the motif completely characterize the crystal.

The cosets by translation subgroup $T$ (the set all translations) form the
\emph{factor} (AKA \emph{quotient}) group $\Group/T$, isomorphic to the point
group $g$ (rotations).
All irreducible representations of a space group \Group\ can be constructed
from irreducible representations of $g$ and $T$.
This step, however, is tricky, as, due to the non-commutativity of
translations and rotations, the quotient group $\Group/T$ is not a normal
subgroup of the space group $\Group$.

The quantum-mechanical calculations are executed by approximating the
infinite crystal by a periodic one, and going go to the \emph{reciprocal}
space  by deploying $\Cn{N}$ discrete Fourier transform. This implements the
$G/T$ quotienting by translations and reduces the calculation to a finite
\emph{Brilluoin zone}. That is the content of the \emph{`Bloch theorem'} of
solid state physics. Further work is then required to reduce the
calculations to the point group irreps.

One would think that the one-dimensional \emph{line groups}, which describe
systems exhibiting translational periodicity along a line, such as carbon
nanotubes, would be simpler still. But even they are not trivial -- there are
13 of them.

The normal subgroup of a line group  $L$ is its translational subgroup $T$,
with its factor group $L/T$ isomorphic to the \emph{isogonal point group $P$}
of discrete symmetries of its 1\dmn\ unit cell $x\in(-a/2,a/2]$. In the
reciprocal lattice $k$ takes on the values in the first Brillouin zone
interval $(-\pi/a,\pi/a]$.
In {\em Irreducible representations of the symmetry groups of polymer
molecules. {I}}, Bo{\v{z}}ovi{\'c}, Vuji{\v{c}}i{\'c} and Herbut\rf{BoVuHe78}
construct all the reps of the line groups whose isogonal point groups are
$C_n , C_{nv}, C_{nh}, S_{2n}$, and $D_n$.
For some of these line groups the irreps are obtained as products of the reps
of the translational subgroup and the irreps of the isogonal point group.

According to W. De~Heer, the Mintmire, Dunlap and White\rf{MiDuWh92} paper {\em
Are Fullerene tubules metallic?} which took care of chiral rotations for
nanotubes by a tight-binding calculation, played a key role in physicists'
understanding of line groups.

Consequences of time-reversal symmetry on line groups are discussed by
Bo{\v{z}}ovi{\'c}\rf{Bozovic81};
In the case when the Hamiltonian is invariant under time
reversal\rf{Herring37}, the symmetry group is enlarged: $L+\theta L$. It is
interesting to learn if the degeneracy of the levels is doubled or not.

Johnston\rf{Johnston60} {\em Group theory in solid state physics} is
one of the many reviews that
%The
%calculus of the irreducible matrix representations of finite groups is
%developed ab initio , including the theory of characters and projection
%operators. The structure of the general crystal space group  is
%developed of the symmetry group of a many-electron system with spin-orbit
%coupling, using the Dirac formalism.
discusses Wigner's time-reversal theorems for a many-electron system,
including the character tests for time-reversal degeneracy, the double space
groups, and the time-reversal theorems (first discussed by
Herring\rf{Herring37} in {\em Effect of time-reversal symmetry on energy
bands of crystals}).

Consider
\[
\rho_{\vec{G}}(\vec{x})= e^{i\vec{G}\cdot\vec{r}(\vec{x})}
\,,
\]
where $\vec{G}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector. By definition,
$\vec{G}\cdot\vec{a}$ is an integer multiple of $2\pi$, $\rho_{\vec{G}}=1$ for
lattice vectors.
For any other state, reciprocal {\lattstate} is given by
\[
e^{i\vec{G}\cdot\vec{u}(\vec{x})} \neq 1
\,.
\]

When a
cube is a building block that tiles a $3D$ cubic lattice, it is referred
to as the `elementary' or `Wigner-Seitz' cell, and its Fourier transform
is called `the first Brillouin zone' in `the reciprocal space'.

\section{Dynamical symmetry factorization}
\label{sect:DynSymmFact}

Here we shall distinguish ``geometrical symmetry"
(invariance of a shape of an object under coordinate translations, reflections,
and rotations.


Physical Symmetry {\em vs.}  Symmetry

% https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/what-is-the-difference-between-dynamical-symmetry-and-geometrical-symmetry.235083/
A dynamical symmetry is often a {\em hidden} symmetry. The classic
example would be the Hydrogen atom. Naively, we would only expect an
SO(3) symmetry associated with rotational symmetry. This would be the
geometrical symmetry, which leads to the conserved angular momentum
vector. In fact, the full symmetry of the system is SO(4); this is
exhibited by there being another conserved vector, the Laplace-Runge-Lenz
(LRL) vector. Since the LRL vector is peculiar to the particular
potential of the hydrogen atom and does not emerge as the result of some
general geometrical feature shared by a whole class of systems (like
rotational symmetry), it is referred to as a \emph{dynamical symmetry}.

Noether?

the symmetry of a particular figure or lattice
in a two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined by a subgroup of
the group of all translations, rotations, reflections and inversions — the
subgroup that converts the object into itself.

Associated with each geometric
object is the set of symmetry operations that leave invariant the relation
between the object and a coordinate system.
These conceptions of symmetry and operations of symmetry have their
basis in Euclidean geometry.

Symmetry in physics means invariance under any
kind of transformation, for example arbitrary coordinate transformations.

The invariance group of an equation is an intrinsic property of the equation.

To avoid this problem, we will henceforth use the words intrinsic symmetry
and intrinsic symmetry groups when speaking of invariance properties of
equations and functions. If functions or equations are left invariant by the
operations of a group of transformations, the group will be said to be an
intrinsic symmetry group of the functions or equations.

The hyperspherical symmetry of Kepler Hamiltonians is a truly dynamical
symmetry — a symmetry present when there is motion. It is a symmetry
that exists only when motion is allowed.

The phrase hidden symmetry is
sometimes used to signify the presence of dynamical symmetry greater than
ordinary geometrical symmetry.

Note; we do not know yet how this section relates to
\refsect{sect:LapReversal}~{\em Laplacians and (time) reversal}.

The antisymmetric $A_2$
subspace \dzeta\ $\zeta_{A_2}$
differs from $\zeta_{A_1}$ only by a minus sign for
cycles with an odd number of $0$'s, see \refeq{zetaA2}.

This is presumably the same as metal cat map zeta \refeq{metalZeta}
except here I chose to count the symmetry-reduced cycles by the $t =
\sqrt{{\mu}^2\,z}$ expansion.

I suspect that the factorization \refeq{Cserti00(39)} is another example
of such factorization, but for a cubic lattice.

They discuss zeta functions of toral automorphisms,
see their \emph{Table 1.} Fixed point and orbit counts for the golden cat map.
\emph{Example 2} is amusing:
    }

The best known hyperbolic toral automorphism is
the `classic' or golden (Fibonacci\rf{BaNeRo13}) cat map (see also \refeq{Wilf94:FibRecGF})
\beq
   M \, = \, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\ee{goldenCat}
It has $\det (M)=-1$ and is thus orientation reversing (sometimes, as in
\refref{Katok95}, its square is used instead).
% From Proposition~\ref{zeta1} or from \cite{BHP},
One obtains
\[
   \zeta^{}_{M} (t)  \, = \, \frac{1-t^2}{1-t-t^2}
   \, = \prod_{m\ge 1} \big(1-t^m\big)^{-c_m}
\]
with $a_m = f_{m+1} + f_{m-1} - \big( 1 + (-1)^m\big)$ and $c_m$
according to Eq.~\refeq{c-from-a}, see also entries \texttt{A${\hspace{0.5pt}}$001350}
and \texttt{A${\hspace{0.5pt}}$060280}. % of \cite{online}.
Here, $f_m$ are the Fibonacci
numbers, defined by the recursion $f_{m+1} = f_m + f_{m-1}$, for $m\ge
0$, together with the initial condition $f_0=0$ and $f_{-1}=1$. The
first few terms of the counts are given in \reftab{BaRoWe08fib-tab}.
Note that $\zeta^{}_{M} (t) = 1 + \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} f_m {\hspace{0.5pt}}
t^m$, and one has $M^m = f_m\, M + f_{m-1}\, \unit$, the latter being valid
for all $m\in\integers$.


   \item[2021-02-12 Han]
By derivation \PCedit{(do it!)} analogous to the Isola's
cat map  ${\zeta}(Z)$ \refeq{Isola90-13b},
the topological zeta function for metal cat maps is
\refeq{metalZeta}
where $z=t^2$,
in agreement with \refeq{AABHM99-46a} for $\mu=1$.
See also \refeq{Wilf94:FibRecGF}.

   \item[2021-02-12 Predrag]
What is this square root of $z$? This is expected, see
\toChaosBook{section.25.5}
{sect.~25.5} {\em $\Zn{2} = \Dn{1}$ factorization}:
[...]
if a cycle
${p}$ is invariant under the symmetry subgroup ${\cal H}_{{p}} \subseteq G$ of
order $h_{{p}}$, its weight can be written as a repetition of a fundamental
domain cycle
\beq
t_{{p}} =  t_{\hat{p}}^{ h_{{p}} }
\label{t-power}
\eeq
computed on the irreducible segment that corresponds to a
fundamental domain cycle. [...] In the $\Dn{1}$ case, $t_{{p}}$

a double repeat of a {\orbit}, $t_{{p}} =  t_{\hat{p}}^2$,

We work out the symmetry reduction and a breaking of the \Dn{3} symmetry in the
$[3\times3]$ permutation matrices representation

\item[2021-06-20 Predrag]
I'll have to rerecord the above video from scratch, \refexam{exam:D3permRep}
discussion of the \Dn{3} symmetry is much more compact and elegant.

\item[2021-06-20 Predrag]
This analysis of \Dn{\cl{}} irreps does not apply to symmetric orbits. For
that on has to look at the subgroup structure of dihedral groups, see
\HREF{https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Subgroup_structure_of_dihedral_groups}
{groupprops wiki}, the subgroup called there $\langle x \rangle$. Han's
discussion of \refeq{HLreflect6}, \refeq{HLreflect6other} and
\refeq{orbJprimeRptHL} counts the broken rotational invariance solutions.

Siemaszko and Wojtkowski\rf{SieWoj11} {\em Counting {Berg} partitions} describe
symmetries of \AW\ partitions. They are present for reversible toral
automorphisms.

\item[2021-07-04 Predrag]
The full symmetry group of a toral automorphism was studied by
Baake and Roberts\rf{BaaRob97}.

\item[2021-07-04 Predrag]
The \emph{infinite dihedral group} $\Dn{\infty}$ \refeq{D_infty} was
introduced by Kim, Lee and Park\rf{KiLePa03} {\em A zeta function for flip
systems} (2003).

Kim, Lee and Park\rf{KiLePa03} give the explicit formula \refeq{Ryu17eq:2.1}
for the Lind zeta function\rf{Lind96} $\zeta_{\Refl}$ (search for ``Lind96''
to find more about it) of a flip system $(\pS,\map,\Refl)$
\refeq{Ryu17eq:1.1}.

[...]
investigate dynamical systems with flip maps \refeq{Ryu17eq:1.1}, regarded as
infinite dihedral group actions. We introduce a zeta function for flip
systems, and find its basic properties including a product formula. When the
underlying \Cn{n}-action is conjugate to a topological Markov shift, the flip
system is represented by a pair of matrices, and its zeta function is
expressed explicitly in terms of the representation matrices.

[...]
Any topological Markov shift whose transition matrix is symmetric has a
natural flip.

[...]
establish a zeta function for flip systems which is a conjugacy invariant,
and give a finite description of the function when the underlying
$\integers$-action is conjugate to a topological Markov shift.

\item[2021-07-04 Predrag]
The much desired -see \refeq{EGfactorSincExcl}- square root and
dependence on $t^2$ finally makes an
appearance in the Lind zeta function \refeq{Ryu17eq:2.1}!

\item[2021-07-04 Predrag]
S. Ryu {\em The Lind Zeta functions of reversal systems of finite order}
\arXiv{1712.03519} (2017) deals with a more general case of reversing operators,
but the LaTeX file was useful for clip \& paste.

If $(\pS,\map)$ is a shift of finite type, then there exists a square matrix
$A$ with non-negative integer entries such that the number of fixed points
$N_\cl{}$ can be expressed in terms of matrices\rf{LindMar95}
\begin{equation}\label{Ryu17eq:2.2}
N_\cl{} = \tr A^\cl{} \qquad (m = 1, 2, \cdots)
\end{equation}
Similarly, when $(\pS,\map,\Refl)$ is a shift-flip system of finite type, the
number of fixed points $N^{\Refl}_\cl{}$ can be expressed in terms of
matrices\rf{KiLePa03}. %, {KR}.

They write:
``
Since there is a dynamical system (X, T) which is not conjugate to its
time reversal $(X, T^{-1})$, not every dynamical system has a flip. See
p.~104 of Boyle, Marcus and Trow\rf{BoMaTr987}.
\\
\textbf{Note}: Predrag does not understand that page. Worse still,
Predrag does not understand any page in the entire monograph :(

In Park\rf{Park88} it is shown that if the underlying $\integers$-actions
are Kolmogorov and isomorphic, there are examples of non-isomorphic
\Dn{\infty}-actions.
''

\item[2021-08-11 Predrag]
Park\rf{Park88} {\em On ergodic foliations} (1988).

The `covering space' has two actions, $\map$ and $\Refl$, where $\map$ is
a $\integers$-action, $\Refl$ is a map of order two, and $\Refl$ and T
skew-commute; that is, $\Refl\map\Refl = \map^{-l}$.
\\
\textbf{Note}: Predrag does not understand this paper, not at all.

\item[2021-07-04 Predrag]
Still to read:

Boyle, Marcus and Trow\rf{BoMaTr987}
{\em Resolving maps and the dimension group for shifts of finite type}
(1987).

Nordin and Noorani\rf{NorNoo21}
{\em Counting finite orbits for the flip systems of shifts of finite type}
(2021).

Yumiko Hironaka
{\em Zeta functions of finite groups by enumerating subgroups},
\arXiv{1410.4326} (2014) is potentially interesting: Hironaka forms zeta
function like Riemann, rather than  Artin-Mazur.

% 2021-01-27 Predrag
Some background on $\Dn{\infty}$ symmetry of the \templatt\ and
{$\phi^4$} 1$d$ lattice field theory, \refsect{s:latt1d} {\em
Translations and reflections}. Time-reversed {\lattstate}s (if not
self-dual under reflection) are counted as pairs, see for example
\toChaosBook{figure.caption.192} {fig. 11.6},
\toChaosBook{exmple.11.11} {example~11.11},
\toChaosBook{exmple.15.6}{Example 15.6} {\em \Cn{2} recoded},
\toChaosBook{figure.caption.308} {fig.~15.15},
\toChaosBook{table.caption.362}{table~18.1}
{\em The 4-disk {\orbit}s up to period 8},
\toChaosBook{table.caption.556}{table~34.1},
the time-reversal discussion in
\toChaosBook{subsection.42.2.3} {section~42.2.3},
and
\toChaosBook{figure.caption.608} {fig.~42.5}.

This is a many-years outstanding frustration, see
\toChaosBook{rmark.16.3} {Remark 16.3} {\em Symmetries of the symbol square}
and
\toChaosBook{rmark.25.2} {Remark 25.2} {\em Other symmetries}.

The zeta functions are still to be factorized in the $z\to{t^2}$ sense,
perhaps as in \refeq{AABHM99-46a}. Then the corresponding ChaosBook
chapters have to be rewritten.
