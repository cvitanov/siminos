\begin{itemize}
  \item
I think it should be little work to verify for \templatt\ that the Boss
determinant \refeq{gridZeta}, \refeq{Rangarajan2}, \refeq{Rangarajan2a}
for the Ihara zeta function (that counts undirected loops) is the Isola's
Bowen-Ruelle zeta \refeq{Ising:Isola90-13}.
This counts walks of the cat map directed Markov graph.
  \item
Clair's square 2D lattice \refeq{IharaGrid} presumably counts
1D loops (returning walks) on a 2D lattice. So does
Kasteleyn\rf{Kasteleyn63} elliptic integral of the first kind
\refeq{IsingZeta} (see also \refeq{Cserti00(38)}).
  \item
For \catlatt\ we count 2D tori (Bravais lattices); expect a variable
$z_j$ for every translational symmetry direction, not a single $z$ as in
\refeq{IsingZeta}. In Ising models, one counts the 2D configurations - so
how come Ihara functions can do that? Or can they?
  \item
Explain the relation between a discrete torus and the Cayley graph.
For example, given $n\in\naturals^*$, let $G_n$ denote the Cayley graph
$\left({{\integers}/{n\integers},\left\lbrace{\pm1}\right\rbrace}\right)$.

\subsection{Heat equation}
\label{sect:heatEq}
    \PC{2020-03-15}{
I like Elaydi\rf{Elaydi05}'s Sect.~3.5.5 {\em The heat equation}
    }
Let $T_{n\zeit}$ be temperature at spatial site $n$ at time $\zeit$. The
heat equation for temperature field $\mathsf{T}=\{T_{n\zeit}\}$ is
\beq
\pde_\zeit \mathsf{T} = D\,\Laplacian_x \mathsf{T}
\,,
\ee{Elaydi05(3.5.22)}
where $D$ is the diffusion constant. Convert this into an integer lattice
difference equation over a finite spacetime domain by the same rescaling
as for \refeq{forwDer}.
Then the heat difference equation for temperature field
$\mathsf{T}=\{T_{n\zeit}\}$ over a finite tile $\LTS{}{}{}$ is
\beq
\pde_\zeit \mathsf{T} = \beta\,\Laplacian_x \mathsf{T}
\,,
\ee{Elaydi05(3.5.22)a}
In the space and time continuum limits, $\beta$ is related to the
diffusion constant by
\[
  \beta = \frac{\Delta\zeit}{(\Delta x)^2}{\diffCon}
        = \frac{\speriod{}^2}{\period{}}{\diffCon}
  \,.

\subsection{Heat kernel}

    \PCpost{2020-05-13}{
For general regular graphs with a transitive group action,
in particular the discrete tori,  a zeta function
has been defined in an impressive paper by
Chinta, Jorgenson and Karlsson\rf{ChJoKa14} {\em Heat kernels on regular
graphs and generalized {Ihara} zeta function formulas}:
Let q be a positive integer and $G$ be a (q + 1)-regular graph. There is
an associated heat kernel $K_G(t, x_0, x)$ corresponding to the Laplacian
formed by considering the adjacency matrix on $G$. The building blocks of
$K_G$ are I-Bessel functions, and the number
of geodesics from a fixed base point $x_0$ to $x$ of length $m$.

$N^0_m$ denotes the number of closed geodesics of length $m$ in $G$ with
base point $x_0$.

They give a clear introduction into heat kernels on graphs, the origin
of I-Bessel functions, and the relationto the number of paths.
They also deduce the classical Ihara determinantal formula.

There is a second expression for the heat kernel coming from spectral
considerations. Equating the two expressions for the heat kernel, as in
known approaches to the Poisson summation formula or the Selberg trace
formula, one obtains an identity which is a type of theta inversion
formula. To this identity they apply an integral transform,
a Laplace transform with a change of variables, and
obtain the logarithmic derivative of the Ihara zeta function.

For finite graphs, the classical Ihara zeta function is their Ihara zeta
function raised to the power equaling the number of vertices (by fixing
the base point $x_0$, they can work with infinite graphs). They give a
formula, their Theorem 1.3, for $1/zeta$ as an integral over the spectral
measure for the Laplacian.

They also count geodesics paths, not only closed geodesics paths. That
corresponds to computing the Hurwitz zeta function instead of the Riemann
zeta function, they say.

{\em Zeta functions, heat kernels, and spectral asymptotics on
degenerating families of discrete tori}:

By a discrete torus we mean the Cayley graph associated to a finite
product of finite cycle groups with the generating set given by choosing
a generator for each cyclic factor.

We examine the
spectral theory of the combinatorial Laplacian for sequences of discrete
tori when the orders of the cyclic factors tend to infinity at comparable
rates. First, we show that the sequence of heat kernels corresponding to
the degenerating family converges, after rescaling, to the heat kernel on
an associated real torus.

We then establish an asymptotic expansion, in
the degeneration parameter, of the determinant of the combinatorial
Laplacian. The zeta-regularized determinant of the Laplacian of the
limiting real torus appears as the constant term in this expansion.

By a classical theorem by Kirchhoff, the determinant
of the combinatorial Laplacian of a finite graph divided by the number of
vertices equals the number of spanning trees, called the complexity, of
the graph. As a result, we establish a precise connection between the
complexity of the Cayley graphs of finite abelian groups and heights of
real tori.

It is also known that spectral determinants on discrete tori
can be expressed using trigonometric functions and that spectral
determinants on real tori can be expressed using modular forms on general
linear groups. Another interpretation of our analysis is thus to
establish a link between limiting values of certain products of
trigonometric functions and modular forms. The heat kernel analysis which
we employ uses I-Bessel functions. Our methods extend
to prove the asymptotic behavior of other spectral invariants through
degeneration, such as special values of spectral zeta functions and
Epstein-Hurwitz–type zeta functions.

 For any $d \geq 1$, let $N =
(n_{1}, \cdots, n_{d})$ denote a $d$-tuple of positive
integers, and consider the product
\begin{equation}\label{ddefinition}
D(N) = \prod\limits_{K \neq 0}\left(2d - 2\cos(2\pi k_{1}/n_{1}) -
\cdots - 2\cos(2\pi k_{d}/n_{d})\right);
\end{equation}
where the product is over all $d$-tuples $K = (k_{1}, \cdots,
k_{d})$ of non-negative integers with $k_{j} < n_{j}$, omitting
the zero vector in the product.

One can view $D(N)$ as a determinant of a naturally defined
matrix from graph theory. Quite generally, associated to any
finite graph, there is a discrete Laplacian which acts on the finite
dimensional space of complex valued functions whose domain of
definition is the space of vertices of the graph.
$D(N)$ is equal to the product of the non-zero eigenvalues of the
Laplacian associated to a graph which we call a discrete torus.

The
$d$-dimensional discrete torus is defined as the product space
$$
DT_{N} = \prod\limits_{j=1}^{d} \ell_{j}{\integers} \backslash
{\integers},
$$

{\em Weighted estimates for the Laplacian on the cubic lattice}:

The starting point for their analysis is a representation of the
summation kernel of the free resolvent (the propagator) in terms of a
product of Bessel functions.

The momentum representation of the discrete Laplacian: one may
diagonalize the discrete Laplacian, using the (unitary) Fourier transform
$\Phi\colon \ell^2({\mathbb Z}^d)\to L^2({\mathbb T}^d)$, where ${\mathbb T}=\R/(2\pi {\mathbb Z})$. It is
defined by
 \[
 (\Phi f)(k)=\widehat f(k)={1\/(2\pi)^{{d\/2}}}\sum_{n\in
 {\mathbb Z}^d} f_ne^{i n\cdot k},\quad \textup{where} \quad
 k=(k_j)_{j=1}^d\in {\mathbb T}^d.
 \]
Here $k\cdot n = \sum_{j=1}^d k_j n_j$ is the scalar product in $\R^d$.
In the resulting momentum representation of the discrete Laplacian
$\Delta$, we write $\widehat \Delta =\Phi \Delta \Phi^*$. The
Laplacian is transformed into a multiplication operator
\[
(\widehat \Delta \widehat f)(k)=\Bigl(\sum_{j=1}^d \cos k_j\Bigr) \widehat f. %=\sum_{j=1}^d
%\rt(-1+2\cos^2 {k_j\/2}\rt).
\]
The operator $e^{it \Delta}, t\in \R$ is unitary  on $L^2({\mathbb T}^d)$ and has  the
kernel $(e^{it \Delta})(n-n')$, where for $n\in{\mathbb Z}^d$:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\label{DiscAsBessel}
(e^{it \Delta})(n) & ={1\/(2\pi)^{d}}\int_{{\mathbb T}^d}
e^{-i n\cdot k+it \sum_{j=1}^d \cos(k_j)}dk\\
& = \prod_{j=1}^d \Bigl(\frac1{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}e^{-in_jk+it\cos(k)}dk\Bigr)
= i^{|n|} \prod_{j=1}^d J_{n_j}(t),
\end{aligned}
\]
where $|n| = n_1+\cdots + n_d$.
Here $J_n(z)$ denotes the Bessel function:
\[\label{BesselFunction}
J_n(t)={(-i)^n\/2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} e^{in k-i t\cos(k)}dk \qquad \forall \
(n,z)\in {\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb R}.
\]
The rest is all about bounds, we can safely ignore it.


   \item[2020-05-14 Predrag]
J{\'e}r{\'e}my Dubout Jeremy.Dubout@unige.ch
is a smart cookie. I'm very impressed by
Dubout\rf{Dubout19}
{\em Zeta functions of graphs, their symmetries and extended Catalan numbers},
 \arXiv{1909.01659}:

It is natural to form symmetric functions of the eigenvalues of
operators, in finite dimensions one has  the trace and determinant. In
infinite dimensions things become more complicated. For example, the
determinant of the Laplace operator on a  manifold cannot be directly
defined, but the following the heat kernel function can
\begin{align}
\label{Dubout19:1}
\zeta_M(s)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \lambda_n^{-s}
  =\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_0^\infty \!\!\!
   \tr\left(e^{-t \Delta}\right) t^s \frac{dt}{t}
\,,
\end{align}
for $s$ in the half-plane $\left\{s|\Re(s)>0\right\}$.
Since graphs have a natural Laplacian $\Delta$, Dubout considers sums
over the eigenvalues as in \refeq{Dubout19:1}, and introduces the
\emph{spectral zeta function} of a graph $G$ as
$$
\zeta_G(s)=\int_{\sigma(\Delta)} x^{-s}\mu_\Delta^{\delta_v,\delta_v}(dx)
\,,
$$
where $\mu_\Delta^{\delta_v,\delta_v}(dx)$ is a spectral measure of the
Laplacian. $\zeta_G$ provides an analogue of the right hand side of
\refeq{Dubout19:1} for graphs. Dubout introduces a heat function~$H_t$
for infinite graphs\rf{FriKar17} as an analogue of the heat kernel for
manifolds:
$$
\zeta_G(s)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_0^\infty H^G_t t^s\frac{dt}{t}
\,.
$$
This spectral zeta function recovers both previous definitions for finite
graphs, the lattice  $\integers^d$ and the infinite $d$-regular tree.
Dubout extends the $\integers$ functional equation\rf{FriKar17} to
$\integers^2$. For more general $s$ an $d>2$ the existence of such
symmetries remains unknown. The formula acts can interpreted as a
symmetry for Catalan numbers. Dubout is able to describe $\zeta_G$
explicitly for $G=\integers^d$ as well as for products for integers
values.

Contrary to the compact manifold case, the heat kernel of an infinite
graph is not always a trace-class operator. Instead of taking its trace,
Dubout therefore evaluates it on the rooted graph, at some cost.

The resolvant
$$R(z,\Delta)=\frac{1}{z-\Delta}.$$

The heat kernel of $\integers$ is given by
$$
H_t^\integers =\int_0^4 \frac{e^{-tx}}{\pi\sqrt{x(4-x)}} dx=e^{-2t}I_0(2t)
\,,
$$
where $I_0$ a modified Bessel function of first kind, the same as
\refref{KarNeu06} (up to a factor~$2$, coming from their normalization of
the Laplacian). Dubout extends this result to $\integers^d$ with
$$
H_t^{\integers^d}=e^{-2dt}I_0(2t)^d
\,.
$$
The spectral zeta function of $\integers$ is given by
\bea
\zeta_{\integers}(s)
  &=& \int_{0}^{4} x^{-s}\frac{1}{ \pi\sqrt{x(4-x)}}dx
= \frac {1}{\pi}\int_0^1 4^{-s} x^{-s-\frac{1}{2}} (1-x)^{-\frac{1}{2}}dx
 \continue
 &=& \frac{4^{-s}}{\pi}\mathbf{B}\left({\frac{1}{2}-s,\frac{1}{2}}\right)
=\frac{4^{-s}}{\sqrt\pi}
 \frac{\Gamma\left({\frac{1}{2}-s}\right)}{\Gamma\left({1-s}\right)}
\,,
\eea
where $\mathbf{B},\Gamma$ are the beta and gamma functions.

The function $\zeta_\integers$ is meromorphic over
$\complex\setminus\left\lbrace{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \dots}\right\rbrace$
and satisfies $$\displaystyle  \zeta_\integers(s)={-2s\choose -s}$$
for any $s$.

For a finite transitive graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the spectral zeta
function $\zeta_G$ can be written in explicit form, similar to the one in
the first part of Equation \ref{Dubout19:1}, and analytically continued
over $\complex$ with the formula
\beq
\zeta_G(s)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{\lambda\neq 0}\lambda^{-s}
\,,
\ee{Dubout19:211}
where the sum is over the non-zero eigenvalues of $\Delta_G$. The
Lebesgue's decomposition theorem allows us to split the spectral measure
into an absolutely continuous part, a singular continuous part and a pure
point part. The only issue with $\zeta_G$'s analyticity is the presence
of $0$ in the spectrum: A graph $G$ is finite if and only if $0$ belongs
to the pure point part. Dubout then does some serious analysis.

Dubout introduces a \emph{regularized} determinant. If $G$ is finite and
transitive, then
$\det^*(x+\Delta)=\det(x\unit+\Delta)^\frac{1}{|V_G|}.$
In the case of the regularized determinant for $\integers$, Dubout almost
gets the generating function of the Catalan numbers:
\beq
\det^*(x+\Delta_\integers)=\frac{x}{2}+1+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{x(4+x)}
    =x+2+\sum_{n\geq 1}  C_n \frac{(-1)^n}{x^{n}}
    \,,
\ee{Dubout19:32}
where $C_n=\frac{1}{n+1}{2n \choose n}$ is the $n$-th Catalan number.
\\
{\bf Predrag}: Amusing, but I've also run into Catalan numbers while
counting rooted trees, back in 1976: Cvitanovi\'c\rf{PCar}
{\em Group theory for {Feynman} diagrams in non-{Abelian} gauge theories}

Dubout computes the standard  characteristic polynomial of the Laplacian
of a cyclic graph, by a new, completely analytical way of obtaining the
coefficients. Given $n\in\naturals^*$, let $G_n$ denote the Cayley graph
$\left({{\integers}/{n\integers},\left\lbrace{\pm1}\right\rbrace}\right)$.
Then
\beq
\det (x+\Delta_{G_n})=\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} {2n-l\choose l}\frac{2n}{2n-l}x^{n-l}
\,.
\ee{Dubout19:36}
The coefficients of $\det(x+\Delta_{G_n})$ can  be computed
numerically using the eigenvalues of $\Delta_{G_n}$. Dubout gets the
our usual discrete Fourier product formula
$$
\det(x+\Delta_{G_n}))=
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \left({x+4 \sin^2\left({\frac{k \pi}{n}}\right)}\right)
\,,
$$
but he did not find a way to expand this product into a polynomial with
integers coefficients.
\\
{\bf Predrag}: we should alert him to our integer-points counting formulas!

Dubout then relates the {Ihara zeta function $Z_G$}\rf{Terras10} of a
$d$-regular finite graph $G$
\beq
Z_G(u)=
\left({(1-u^2)^{\frac{(d-2)|V_G|}{2}}\det\left({1-(d-\Delta_G)u+(d-1)u^2}\right)}\right)^{-1}.
\ee{Dubout19:322}
to his spectral zeta function.
Given a $d$-regular finite graph $G$ with $n$ vertex, the Ihara zeta
function of $G$ can be computed as
\beq
Z_G(u)= \left({y_u\det^*\left({x_u+\Delta_G}\right)}\right)^{-n}
\,,
\ee{Dubout19:fe}
with
$y_u=u (1-u^2)^{\frac{d}{2}-1}$ and $x_u=(1-\frac{1}{u})(u(d-1)-1)$.

The  appearance of $|V_G|$  in \refeq{Dubout19:fe} as only an
exponent provides good motivation for defining a modified Ihara zeta
function that extends to infinite graphs:

The \textit{regularized Ihara zeta function} of a  (possibly infinite)
d-regular graph $G$ is defined as
\beq
Z^*_G(u)=
{u^{-1}(1-u^2)^{1-\frac{d}{2}}
 \det^*\left({\left(1-\frac{1}{u}\right)(u(d-1)-1)+\Delta_G}\right)}^{-1}
\,.
\ee{Dubout19:24343}
This coincides with the known one for the Cayley graph of a finitely
generated group.

It follows from \refeq{Dubout19:fe} that if $G$ is finite then
$Z^*_G(u)^{|V_G|}=Z_G(u).$ This allows us to extend the functional
equations  to infinite regular graphs.

The regularized determinant of $\integers$ was calculated in
\refeq{Dubout19:32}, and following \refeq{Dubout19:24343} he obtains
the regularized Ihara zeta function of $\integers$:
\beq
    Z_\integers^*(u) = \begin{cases}
              1 & \text{if } 0<|u| < 1,\\
              u^2 & \text{if } |u| > 1.
          \end{cases}
\ee{Dubout19:henduwqed}
Note the functional equation
$$
Z_\integers^*\left({\frac{1}{u}}\right)= \frac{1}{u^2}Z_\integers^*(u)
\,.
$$

That $Z_\integers^*(u)=1$ for $0<u<1$ is a natural result, as the original
definition of the Ihara zeta function is a generating function of
weighted loops, and $\integers$ does not have any, giving us only $1$ as
generating function. The same argument holds for any tree-like
graph.

   \item[2020-05-14 Predrag]
Lenz, Pogorzelski and Schmidt\rf{LePoSc14} {\em The {Ihara} zeta
function for infinite graphs}, \arXiv{1408.3522}, a very lengthy and
ambitious paper, apparently gives yet another definition of
an Ihara zeta function for infinite graphs.
Dubout was unable do
determine how it compares to his \refeq{Dubout19:322}.
I'm not frisky enough to read this paper, after having gone through
Dubout already today...

\subsection{Clair / Clair14}
\label{sect:Clair14}

For the two dimensional integer lattice a zeta function has been defined
and computed in
Clair\rf{Clair14}
{\em The {Ihara} zeta function of the infinite grid}

\HREF{http://math.slu.edu/~clair/}{Bryan Clair} is a great fan of
\HREF{http://math.slu.edu/~clair/preprints/2013-nov-ams-ucr.pdf}
{Ihara zeta functions}.

Shahriar Mokhtari-Sharghi\rf{ClMoSh01,ClMoSh02} have shown that Ihara's
construction can be extended to infinite graphs on which a discrete group
acts isomorphically and with finite quotient. Their works seems to deal with
trees, not lattices, though Clair\rf{Clair14} does discuss infinite square
lattice, see \refeq{ClairGrid}.

The Ihara zeta function may be considered as a modification of the Selberg
zeta function\rf{Bass92}, and was originally written in terms of the variable
$s$, where $z= q^{-s}$.
One of main properties of the Ihara zeta function is the \emph{determinant
formula}, \ie, that its inverse is the determinant of a matrix-valued
polynomial.
A consequence of the determinant formula is that the Ihara zeta function
meromorphically extends to the whole complex plane, and its completions
satisfy a functional equation.

The main formula in all these papers gives a connection between the zeta
function, originally defined as an infinite product, and the Laplacian of the
graph.

Pollicott\rf{Pollicott01} explains in {\em Dynamical zeta functions} Sect.~3.3
what the Laplacian for a undirected graph is, relates it to the adjacency matrix
in a somewhat obvious way, as we are used to on a lattice. He defines Ihara
for undirected graph
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
the graph G has valency $q + 1$ with $q \geq 2$ (i.e., every vertex has $q +
1$ edges attached)
  \item
there is at most one edge between any two vertices
  \item
there are no edges starting and finishing at the same vertex
\end{enumerate}
He outlines a  proof  of  the Bass determinant formula for
the Bowen-Lanford zeta function.

                                                \toCB
\begin{description}
  \item[Loop:] A closed path in $G$, up to cyclic equivalence, without
backtracking.
  \item[Prime:]
 A loop $p$ which is not a power (a repeat) of another loop.
  \item[Back-track:]
A path has a back-tracking if a subsequence of the form $\cdots,x , y , x ,
\cdots$ appears.
\end{description}

The Ihara zeta function of a finite graph $G$
\beq
\zeta(z) = \prod_p \frac{1}{1-z^\cl{p}}
\ee{ClairIhara}
It is instructive to have a look at the octahedral graph in Clair's talk
above. There is no self-crossing condition, so $\zeta(z)$ always has an
infinity of prime cycles, of arbitrary length (as does any {\tzeta}).

As a power series in $z$, the Ihara zeta has non-negative coefficients,
and thus a finite radius of convergence. However, the inverse of the
Ihara zeta is a polynomial.


Ihara considered the special case of regular graphs (those all of whose vertices have the same degree; i.e., the same number of oriented edges coming out of the vertex). A graph is $k$-regular if every vertex has degree $k$.

Terras\rf{Terras10} defines the  $m \times m$ {\em adjacency} matrix as,
\index{adjacency matrix}
\bea
A_{ij} &=& \left\{
             \begin{array}{ll}
 k & \mbox{if a transition $\pS_j$
       $\rightarrow$ $\pS_i$ is possible in $k$ ways} \\
 2\,\ell_j
   & \mbox{if } i=j \\
 0 & \mbox{otherwise}
    \,,
             \end{array}
               \right.
\label{adj_matTerras}
\eea
where $\ell_j$ is the number of loops at vertex $j$. She then assigns to
every of the $e$ unoriented edges a pair of oriented edges. Her graphs
are finite, connected and undirected, without ``backtracks" and ``tails".
It will usually be assumed that they contain no degree 1 vertices (called
``leaves" or ``hair" or ``danglers"). We will also usually assume the
graphs are not cycles or cycles with hair. A cycle graph is obtained by
arranging the vertices in a circle and connecting each vertex to the 2
vertices next to it on the circle. We will allow our graphs to have loops
and multiple edges. For any closed loop, the equivalence class is the set
of all its cyclic permutations. Two loops are equivalent if they differ
only by the starting vertex.

Terras:
We do not consider zeta functions of infinite graphs here. Nor do we
consider directed graphs. Zeta functions for such graphs are discussed,
for example, by Matthew Horton\rf{Horton07}.

There is no unique factorization into primes. The only nonprimes are
powers of primes. We distinguish prime $p$ from $p^{-1}$ which is the
loop traversed in the opposite direction. All graphs have infinity of
primes, with exception of the cycle graph that has only 2 primes
$p,p^{-1}$, traversing the vertices in the opposite directions.

\textbf{Theorem}\rf{Ihara66,Bass92}:
Consider  a finite connected graph $G$  (without degree 1 vertices) with
$m$ vertices, $e$ unoriented (or undirected) edges, $\mbox{deg }m_i$ the
number of (undirected) edges going into vertex $i$. Let $A$ be the
adjacency matrix, $Q$ be the $m \times m$ diagonal matrix with
$Q_{ii} = \mbox{deg }m_i - 1$,
and
$\Delta_z = I -zA + z^2Q$.
The (vertex) adjacency matrix A of $G$ is a $m \times m$ matrix whose i,j
entry is the number of directed edges from vertex i to vertex j. The
matrix $ Q$ is a diagonal matrix whose j-th diagonal entry is 1 less than
the degree of the j-th vertex. If there is a loop at a vertex, it
contributes 2 to the degree.
\beq
1/\zeta(z) = (1 -z^2)^{e-m} \det\Delta_z
\ee{IharaTheo}
(then comes Riemann Hypothesis for the spectrum of a regular graph $G$,
and Ramanujan graphs).

See {\bf 2020-05-11 Bharatram Rangarajan} \refeq{Rangarajan17:templattGenFct}
below for another derivation of the
same.
\\

Next, consider the `grid' zeta function for $G$
the infinite grid, \ie, a square 2D lattice. Let
$\pi = \integers \times \integers$ be a translation acting on $G$.
The zeta function is still
\beq
\zeta(z) = \prod_{[p]} \frac{1}{1-z^\cl{p}}
\ee{ClairGrid}
where $[p]$ is an equivalence class of loops
under translation by $\pi$:
\beq
1/\zeta(z) = (1 -z^4)^2 (1 -z^6)^4(1 -z^8)^{26}
             (1 -z^10)^{152} \cdots
\ee{IharaGrid}
(look at the 8-loops in Clair's talk - there seems to be an extra factor 2
in loop counting. I only see two 6-loops, not four).

On infinite graphs, the adjacency matrix becomes an

Given any directed graph G if B is the incidence matrix of G, A is the
adjacency matrix of G, and D is the degree matrix such that
$D_{ii}=d(v_i)$, then
\beq
B\transp{B} = D - A
\,.
\ee{gaphLapl}
The matrix $L=D-A$ is called the (unnormalized) graph Laplacian of
the graph G.
$B\transp{B}$ is independent of the orientation of G and
D-A is symmetric, positive, semidefinite; that is, the eigenvalues of D.

Each row of L sums to zero (because $\transp{B}{\bf1}=0$). Consequently,
the vector $\bf1$ is in the nullspace of L.

The connection between the incidence matrix of a graph and its Laplacian
is the well-known equation $L=\partial \transp{\partial}$.

{\em The {Ihara-Selberg} zeta function of a tree lattice}.
It seems that Ihara zeta function walks carry signs - investigate.

He also introduces the \emph{edge zeta function}
to give a determinant form of Ihara zeta function for
undirected graph. This text is from Zhou, Xiao and He\rf{ZhXiHe15},
\arXiv{1502.05771}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item
The \textbf{edge matrix} $W$ of size $[2m \times 2m]$ for an undirected
graph with $m$ undirected edges has entries $w_{ij}$. The $(i,j)$-th
entry of $W$, $w_{ij}$, is a complex variable if the edge $e_i$ is
connected with edge $e_j$ with $e_j \neq e_i^{-1}$, and the entry is 0 if
otherwise.
	\item
For a closed path $C$ in an undirected graph $X$ written as a sequence of
edges $C = e_1e_2 \cdots e_s$, the \textbf{edge norm} of $C$ is
	\[N_E(C) = w_{12}w_{23} \cdots w_{s1}.\]
\end{itemize}
The edge zeta function is defined as follows
\[\zeta_E(W,X) = \prod_{[P] \in \rm{Prime \ Cycles}} (1-N_E(C))^{-1}. \]
It is clear from this definition that if $w_{ij}$ is set to $z \in
\mathbb{C}$, we recover the original Ihara zeta function such that
\[\zeta_G(z) = \zeta_E(W_1,G),\]
where $W_1$ is the edge matrix when all non-zero entries set to $z$.

Furthermore, we have the following formula (cf. Chapter 3 of
Terras\rf{Terras10})
\beq
\zeta_E(W,G) = {\rm Det}(I - W)^{-1}

I worry a lot about what time-reversibility means - {\catlatt} is both
time and space reversible, and then there are Ihara zeta functions for
undirected graphs. So I find this interesting: Coppersmith, Kadanoff and
Zhang\rf{CopKadZha01} {\em Reversible {Boolean} networks {I:} distribution of
cycle lengths}. They write: ``
We [...] consider time-reversible dynamics of N Boolean variables models,
with the time evolution of each depending on K of the other variables, which
necessarily have the property that every possible point in the state space is
an element of one and only one cycle. The orbits can be classified by their
behavior under time reversal. The orbits that transform into themselves under
time reversal have properties quite different from those that do not; in
particular, a significant fraction of latter-type orbits have lengths
enormously longer than orbits that are time-reversal symmetric. For large K
and moderate N, the vast majority of points in the state space are on one of
the time-reversal singlet orbits. However, for any finite K, the random
hopping approximation fails qualitatively when N is large enough (N>22K).
When K is large, typical orbit lengths grow exponentially with N, whereas for
small enough K, typical orbit lengths grow much more slowly with N. The
numerical data are consistent with the existence of a phase transition at
which the average orbit length grows as a power of N at a value of K between
1.4 and 1.7. However, in the reversible models, the interplay between the
discrete symmetry and quenched randomness can lead to enormous fluctuations
of orbit lengths and other interesting features that are unique to the
reversible case.

The zeros and poles of the Selberg zeta
function appear in the Selberg trace formula, which relates the
distribution of primes with the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
of the surface. The idea of considering closed geodesics as primes
inspired the work of Hashimoto\rf{Hashimoto89}, Bass\rf{Bass92}, Kotani

discrete setting.

Just like the Selberg zeta function is related to the spectrum of the
Laplace-Beltrami operator of the surface, it is natural to ask if its
discrete analogue, the Ihara zeta function of a graph, is related to the
spectrum of the Laplacian matrix (or the adjacency matrix) of the graph.
Bass\rf{Bass92} gives an expression for the Ihara zeta function of a
graph $G=(V,E)$ as
$$
\zeta_G(t) = \frac{1}{(1-t^2)^{|E|-|V|} \det(I-tA+(D-I)t^2)}

of degrees of the vertices of $G$, or in other words, $D=diag(A\vec{1})$.

Most proofs Bass's determinant formula start by expressing the zeta
function in terms of not the adjacency matrix $A$ of $G$, but the
adjacency matrix $H$ of the oriented line graph of $G$ (called the
Hashimoto edge-incidence matrix).

In this paper, we shall see a more elementary combinatorial proof of
Bass's determinant formula in the case when $G$ is regular.
The proof goes as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
    The zeta function $\zeta_G({z})$ has an expansion of the form
$$
\zeta_G({z})= \exp\left( \sum \limits_{k=1}^{\infty} N_k \frac{{z}^k}{k} \right)
$$
where for $k \in \integers$, $N_k$ is the number of rooted,
\emph{non-backtracking} cycles in $G$ of length $k$.
\item
    An expression for $N_k$ is not immediate, the starting
    point is the study of non-backtracking walks on $G$. We can construct
    the family $\{A_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\small{\geq 0}}}$ of $n \times
    n$ matrices such that for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\small{\geq0}}$
    and every $v,w \in V$, $(A_k)_{vw}$ is the number of
    non-backtracking walks on $G$ of length $k$ from $v$ to $w$.
\item
    $N_k$ is combinatorially computable from $\Tr(A_k)$.
\item
    $\Tr(A_k)$ is well-understood in terms of the eigenvalues of $A$ and
    a family of Chebyshev polynomials. These ingredients lead to a proof
    of Bass's determinant formula.
\end{itemize}


%\section{Non-backtracking walks and Chebyshev polynomials}
$(A^k)_{vw}$ counts the total number of walks (with backtrackings) on $G$
from $v$ to $w$ of length $k$. Let
$$A_0,A_1,A_2,A_3,\dots$$
be $[n \times n]$ matrices over $\complex$ such that the value $(A_k)_{vw}$
is the number of \emph{non-backtracking} walks on $G$ from $v$ to $w$ of length
$k$. This family $\{A_k\}_{k \in \integers}$ can be recursively defined
using powers of $A$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A_0=I$
\item $A_1=A$
\item $A_2=A^2-dI$
\item For $k \geq 3$,
$$A_k=A\,A_{k-1}-(d-1)A_{k-2}$$
\end{itemize}
This recurrence relation shows that the
ordinary (matrix) generating function for the above sequence is
$$\sum \limits_{k=0}^{\infty} {z}^k A_k = (1- {z}^2)I.
  \left( I-{z}A + (d-1){z}^2 I \right)^{-1}$$
\ie, generating function
$$\frac{1-{z}^2}{1-A{z}+(d-1){z}^2}$$

Consider the
family of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind
$$U_0(x), U_1(x), U_2(x), \dots $$
defined by the recurrence
$$U_0(x)=1$$
$$U_1(x) = 2x$$
and for $k \geq 2$,
$$U_k(x) = U_{k-1}(x)U_1(x) - U_{k-2}(x)$$
and with generating function
$$\sum \limits_{k=0}^{\infty} U_k(x){z}^k = \frac{1}{1-2x{z}+{z}^2}$$

It is easy to see that
$$\sum \limits_{0 \leq j \leq k/2} A_{k-2j} = (d-1)^{k/2} U_k \left( \frac{A}{2\sqrt{d-1}} \right)$$
implying that for $k \geq 2$,
$$A_k = (d-1)^{k/2} U_k \left( \frac{A}{2 \sqrt{d-1}} \right)
      - (d-1)^{k/2-1} U_{k-2} \left( \frac{A}{2 \sqrt{d-1}} \right)$$
This holds for $0 \leq k \leq 2$ as well, if
$$U_m(x) = 0$$
for every $m < 0$. This allows us to work with the above expression for
$A_k$ for \emph{all} non-negative integers $k$.

Taking trace on both
sides,
$$
\Tr(A_k) = (d-1)^{k/2} \sum \limits_{j=0}^{n-1}
             U_k \left( \frac{\mu_i}{2 \sqrt{d-1}} \right)
         -(d-1)^{k/2-1} \sum \limits_{i=0}^{n-1}
             U_{k-2} \left( \frac{\mu_i}{2 \sqrt{d-1}} \right) $$
where
$$d=\mu_0 \geq \mu_1 \geq \dots \geq \mu_{n-1} \geq d$$
are the $n$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A$. Thus we have an
expression for the trace of $A_k$ as a polynomial in the eigenvalues of
$A$.
% This approach is used in the seminal work of Lubotzky, Phillips and
% Sarnak in their construction of Ramanujan graphs. % \cite{lps},
For a detailed and elementary exposition of Chebyshev polynomials and
non-backtracking walks on regular graphs, the reader is referred to the
monograph by Davidoff, Sarnak and Valette\rf{DaSaVa03}.

While $(A_k)_{vw}$ counts the number of walks on $G$ from vertex $v$ to
vertex $w$ without backtracking, the diagonal element
$(A_k)_{vv}$ does \emph{not} count the number of non-backtracking cycles
of length $k$ rooted at $v$. This is because $(A_k)_{vv}$ also counts
walks of the form
$$e_1 e_2 \dots e_k$$
where $e_{i+1} \neq \overline{e_i}$ for any $1 \leq i \leq k-1$ but
$e_k = \overline{e_1}$. That is, $e_1 e_2 \dots e_k$ is non-backtracking
as a walk from $v$ to $v$, but when considered as a closed walk (or a
loop), the two end edges form a backtracking! Such an instance of a
backtracking that gets overlooked in $\Tr(A_k)$ shall be referred to as a
\emph{tail}.

So $\Tr(A_k)$ counts the number of closed, rooted walks
of length $k$ that could have at most $1$ tail, and hence does \emph{not}
count the  rooted, non-backtracking cycles of length $k$. It is
interesting to ask what the number of closed, rooted non-backtracking
walks of length $k$ is.

Relation between $M_k=\Tr(A_k)$ and $N_k$:
For every $k \geq 3$,
$$N_k = \begin{cases}
M_k - (d-2) (M_{k-2}+M_{k-4}+\dots+M_1) & \text{ odd   }k \\
M_k - (d-2) (M_{k-2}+M_{k-4}+\dots+M_2) & \text{ even }k
\end{cases}$$
By linearity of trace,
$$N_k=\begin{cases}
\Tr\left( A_k - (d-2)(A_{k-2}+A_{k-4}+\dots+A_1) \right) & \text{ if k is odd}\\
\Tr\left( A_k - (d-2)(A_{k-2}+A_{k-4}+\dots+A_2) \right) & \text{ if k is even}\\
\end{cases}$$
[... after a few steps ... this is related to]
$$U_k(x) - U_{k-2}(x) = 2 T_k(x)$$
where $T_k(x)$ is the \emph{Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind}
defined by
\bea
T_0(x) &=& 1\,,\quad
T_1(x)=x

T_k(x)  &=&  2x T_{k-1}(x) - T_{k-2}(x)

\subsection{Maillard}
\label{sect:Maillard}

Another scary line of literature. Connecting Baxter to dynamical zetas
functions. Maillardinians have a burst at the end of 20th century. Very easy
to collect the literature, as only they cite their own articles, and nobody
else cites them.

A cute cat map exercise - but I have to bike home, will continue
later...

Angl{\`e}s d'Auriac, Boukraa and Maillard\rf{AnBoMa99}
{\em Functional relations in lattice statistical mechanics, enumerative
combinatorics, and discrete dynamical systems} write `` ... non-linear
functional relations appearing in [...] lattice statistical mechanics [...]
We then consider discrete dynamical systems corresponding to birational
transformations. The rational expressions for dynamical zeta functions
obtained for a particular two-dimensional birational mapping, depending on
two parameters [...] compatible with a chaotic dynamical system.

They obsess about the Arnol'd complexity, which counts the number of
intersections between a fixed line  and its $n$th iterate. I do not see why
we should care.

I like Bedford and Diller\rf{BedDil05} {\em Real and complex dynamics of a
family of birational maps of the plane: {The} golden mean subshift} better,
so I follow their notation here. It's a rather impressive paper.

For reasons known to some people (symmetries of Baxter models?) they study a
birational transformation and its inverse,
\bea
\begin{array}{ccl}
 x_{n+1} &=& y_n\,\frac{x_n + a}{x_n - 1}         \\
 y_{n+1} &=& x_n + a - 1
\end{array}
    \qquad
\begin{array}{ccl}
 x_{n-1} &=& y_n + 1-a    \\
 y_{n-1} &=& x_n\,\frac{y_n - aa}{y_n + 1}
\end{array}
\,,\qquad a\in\reals
\,.
\label{eq:AABHM99-3}
\eea
The map is area-preserving in the sense that it preserves a meromorphic
2-form
\[
\frac{dx\wedge dy}{y-x+1}
\]
and is reversible, which means that the map is conjugate to its
inverse via involution $(x,y)\to(-y,-x)$.
The inverse transformation amounts to $y_n\leftrightarrow -z_n$, \ie, the
time reversal symmetry, and the $x-y=0$ line is the \emph{time-reversal
invariant line}.
The {\tzeta} for \refeq{eq:AABHM99-3} is
\beq
\zetatop(z) =  \frac{1 - z - z^2}
                    {1 - z^2}
 \,.
\ee{AABHM99-28}
It counts all \po s, real and complex.
Interestingly, this zeta satisfies an elegant functional relation
relating $\zeta(z)$ and $\zeta(1/z)$.

The zeta function for real roots is complicated and depends on the parameter
$a$.

                                        \toCB
Bedford and Diller\rf{BedDil05} construct a generating partition and the
Markov diagram (they call that Graph of Filtration), including the transient
nodes. The recurrent part of this graph is just the golden mean graph, with
11 repeats forbidden. They obsess much about their ``rectangles.'' Show that
all \po s are hyperbolic. Discuss pre-periodic orbits. Zeta functions are
never mentioned, though topological entropy is computed.

Abarenkova \etal\rf{AABHM99} {\em Rational dynamical zeta functions for
birational transformations} is not worth reading - the material is better
explained in their other papers.

If the dynamical zeta function can be interpreted as the ratio of two
characteristic polynomials of two linear operators  $A$ and $B$, namely
\beq
\frac{1}{\zeta(z)}=\frac{\det(1-zA)}{\det(1-zB)}
\,,
\ee{AABHM99-56a}
then the number of fixed points is given by
\beq
\Tr(A^n)-\Tr(B^n)
\,.
\ee{AABHM99-56b}
In this linear
operators framework, the rationality of the $\zeta$
function\rf{Guckenheimer70,manning}, and therefore the algebraicity of the
exponential of the topological entropy, amounts to having a finite dimensional
representation of the linear operators $A$ and $B$.

Their only explicit example of a rational zeta dynamical
function is the case of the Arnol'd cat map on torus
\(\mathbb{T}^2 =  \reals^2/\integers^2\,,\)
\beq
 {A} =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
 2 & 1 \\
 1 & 1
  \end{array} \right)
\,,\qquad
 {B} =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 1
  \end{array} \right)
\ee{AABHM99-56c}
The {\tzeta}\rf{Isola90} for Arnol'd cat map is
\beq
\zetatop(z)
    = \frac{\det(1-zA)}{\det(1-zB)}
    =  \frac{1 - 3 z + z^2}
                  {(1 - z)^2}
 \,.

From my notes on Isola\rf{Isola90}
{\em {$\zeta$}-functions and distribution of periodic orbits of toral automorphisms},
see \refsect{sect:Isola90}: [...]
The {\tzeta} for cat-map class of models is (see \refeq{AABHM99-46})
\beq
\zetatop(z) % = \frac{(1 - \Lambda z) (1 - \Lambda^{-1} z)}
            %        {(1 - z)^2}
           =  \frac{1 - s z + z^2}
                  {(1 - z)^2}
 \,.
\ee{Ising:Isola90-13}
Define
\beq
d(s)
= {z^{-1} - {s} + z}
\ee{detCat}
then (compare with \refeq{AABHM99-56a})
\beq
  \zetatop(z)
  = \frac{d(s)}{d(2)}
  = 1+\frac{d(s)-d(2)}{d(2)}
  = 1 - {\mu}^2\frac{1}{d(2)}
\ee{zetaCat}

I wonder whether the fact that this is quadratic in $z$ has something to do
with the time-reversibility, and the unsigned graph's Ihara zeta functions?

The ``characteristic function''  \refeq{FGHLW74:charFunct1d}
for the 3-point recurrence centered on the $s$ term, $1/z-s+z$ suggests
multiplying \refeq{Ising:Isola90-13} by $z^{-1}/z^{-1}$. That leads to
\beq
\zetatop(z) = 1 + \frac{{\mu}^2}
                  {(1 - z)(1 -1/z)}
           =  1 + \left(
                   \frac{z}{1 - z} + \frac{1/z}{1 - 1/z}
                  \right){\mu}^2
\,.
\ee{IIsola90-13d}
Interpretation: the \templatt\ zeta function denominator is
the Laplacian, and ${\mu}^2$ is measuring the deviation from the pure Laplacian
case (marginal, no solutions other than the $n=1$ (line of) fixed point(s).

Conversely, given the \tzeta, the generating
function for the number of temporal {\lattstate}s of period $\cl{}$ is
given by the logarithmic derivative of the {\tzeta} \refeq{zetatop-N},
\bea
\sum_{{n}=0}^\infty N_{n} z^{n}
    & = & \frac{2-{s}z}{1 - s z + z^2}-\frac{2}{1 - z}
      =   \frac{2/z-{s}}{1/z - s + z}-\frac{2}{1 - z}
    \continue
& = & \frac{(2/z-{s})(1 - z)-2(1/z - s + z)}{(1/z - s + z)(1 - z)}

To me it looks like we should include (time reflection symmetry!) also
negative $n$ in the $z^n$ series (Laurent series?), with a negative sign,
so I get
