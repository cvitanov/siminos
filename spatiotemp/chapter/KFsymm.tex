I was careless. Looks much simpler than \Dn{4}.
The generator \LieEl\ of the vertical \emph{cyclic symmetry group}
$\Zn{2n}=\{e,\LieEl,\LieEl^2,\cdots,\LieEl^{2n-1}\}$
of order $2n$ is a \emph{glide reflection}\rf{PlSiFi91}
\beq
\LieEl \, \bu(x,y)=
\begin{pmatrix}
- u(-x,y+\pi/n)\\
v(-x,y+\pi/n)
\end{pmatrix}
\,,
\ee{GlideRefl}
All $2n$ irreps are 1\dmn, with characters $\chi(g^{k}) = \omega^k$,
$\omega=\exp(\pi/n)$.
For $n=4$ the 8 irreps Frobenius character projection
operators \refeq{irrepFncts} are the discrete Fourier transforms
\bea
% && \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad

      \, \uEQ      %~~~~  +  ~~  -     ~~
    \label{globalKFframe}\\
\beUBg{3} &=& \frac{c_{1}}{8}
              (1 + \omega^{-3}  \LieEl^3 + \omega^{-6}\LieEl^6 + \cdots )
      \, \uEQ      %~~~~  -  ~~  +     ~~   - - 4n-2 2n + 2(n-1)
     \continue
\beUBg{2n-1} &=& \frac{c_{2}}{8}
              (1  + \omega\LieEl^{2n-1} + \cdots)
      \, \uEQ      %~~~~  -  ~~  -     ~~   +
    \nnu
\,,
\eea
The invariant subgroups are the cyclic groups $\{e\}$,
$\Zn{2} = \{e,\LieEl^4\}$ (translations by $\pi$),
$\Zn{4} = \{e,\LieEl^2,\LieEl^4,\LieEl^6\}$ (translations by $\pi/2$),
and \Zn{8}.

Aside: Should also understand first the relation between a fundamental domain for
\Zn{3} (3-disk in magnetic field) and these complex eigenvectors.

However, the rotation
\beq
R\,\bu = [-u(-x,-y),-v(-x,-y)]
\ee{KFrot}
does not commute with vertical \Zn{2n},
    \PC{2015-06-24}{please recheck}
\[
R \LieEl\,\bu = R [-u(-x,y+\pi/4),v(-x,y+\pi/4)]
         = [ u( x,-y-\pi/4),-v(x,-y-\pi/4)]
\]
\[
\LieEl R\,\bu = \LieEl [-u(-x,-y),-v(-x,-y)]
         = [ u( x,-y+\pi/4),-v(x,-y+\pi/4)]
\,,
\]
so the full order 16 group is more complicated than $\Zn{8}\times \Zn{2}$
(for possible groups \HREF{http://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Groups_of_order_16}{click here}).
Instead, we have
\[
\LieEl^{-1} R\,\bu = \LieEl [-u(-x,-y),-v(-x,-y)]
         = [ u( x,-y-\pi/4),-v(x,-y-\pi/4)]
\,,
\]
so the generator algebra is of \Dn{8}:
\beq
R^2=e       \,,\quad
\LieEl^8=e \,,\quad
R \LieEl = \LieEl^{-1} R
\,.

The  \Dn{8} group
\[\Dn{8}=\{e,\LieEl,\LieEl^2,\LieEl^3,\cdots,\LieEl^7,
           R,R\LieEl^2,R\LieEl^3,\cdots,R\LieEl^7 \}

has a
$8$ shift elements and $8$ shift-reflect elements.
There are $7$ classes:
$\{e\}$,
$\{\LieEl^4\}$,
$\{\LieEl^2,\LieEl^6\}$,
$\{R,R\LieEl^4\}$ and
$\{R\LieEl^2,R\LieEl{3/4}\}$.
There are four different one-dimensional irreducible representations,
whose characters are $\pm 1$ under reflection $R$ and shift-reflect
operation $R\LieEl$.
There are three 2-dimensional representations $E_j$.
It has 3 subgroups:  \Zn{4},  \Dn{2} and  \Zn{2}.
Life can be made easier by defining the quarter-shift as
$\LieEl{} = \LieEl$,
with $R^2=e$, $\LieEl^8=e$, and
$R\LieEl=\LieEl^{-1}R$.

Reading Platt, Sirovich, and Fitzmaurice\rf{PlSiFi91}:

For {Kolmogorov} flow they credit
V. I. Arnold and L. D. Meshalkin, Usp. Mat. Nauk 15, 247 (1960),
an article that I have not had a look at.

Stability was studied in the above article, as well as by Green\rf{Green74}.
Green studies various stable solutions, and does not cite Kolmogorov.

A stationary cellular
pattern that appears beyond the first bifurcation was discussed
G. I. Sivashinsky, Physica D 17, 243 (1985).

G. I. Sivashinsky and V. Yakhot, Phys. Fluids 28, 1040 (1985);
V. Yakhot and G. I. Sivashinsky, Phys. Rev. A 35, 815 ( 1987)
interpret long-wavelength instabilities as `negative viscosity'.

One needs to also look at
N. F. Bondarenko,. M. Z. Gak, and F. V. Dolzhansky, Atmos. Ocean.
Phys. 15, 711 (1979).

This system has \eqv\ solution
\beq
u(x,y)=\frac{Re}{n^2}\sin(n y),\quad v(x,y)=0,
\ee{KFeqv0blog}
A Reynolds number $\Reynolds$ for the flow may be naturally based on the
maximum speed of this solution, and the forcing length scale. This \eqv\
goes unstable at $\Reynolds=n\sqrt{2}$. Sufficiently high wavenumber
eigenvectors are always stable. They define doubly-periodic rectangular
domain
\[
(x,y)\in [0,2\pi]\times [0,2\pi]
\]
They use a spectral basis that is automatically divergence free,
and compute for the $n = 4$ case.
All runs are initiated as random perturbations off the ustable \eqv\
\refeq{KFeqv0blog}. 5000 + time units were integrated before
before any data were recorded.
[$16 \times 16$] spatial grid gave rise to underresolved
flows that were drastically different in nature, so their computations are
for [$32 \times 32$]  (i.e., 1024 ordinary differential equations).
This was
found adequate for the parameter range
$\Omega/\Omega_c<12.5$.

A stable \reqv\ bifurcates of an \eqv\ up at $\Omega/\Omega_c = 2.2$,
with phase velocity starting with 0.

For $1.97<\Omega/\Omega_c<2.2$ one is in regime where stable \eqv\ with
horizontal $\Zn{2}$ (or $\Dn{2}$ or some other symmetry?) rules.
This symmetry is also noted by Green\rf{Green74}. Apparently all stable
equilibria up to and including this one are invariant under the full
16-element discrete symmetries.

They find it remarkable that narrow stability windows in $\Omega/\Omega_c$
appear interspersed between chaotic episodes. Looks sensible to me.

Of all the chaotic states they observed, fig.~14 is the only state that
they dare
chaotic both spatially and temporally and hence
turbulent, according to common convention.



Their Kaplan-Yorke (`Lyapunov') dimension is accurate to the first digit only.
By the time they get to $\Omega/\Omega_c=12.5$ it is about 11.

\emph{Poincar\'e sections} were computed following Keefe\rf{Keefe85}. They
realize that the Poincar\'e section planes should be invariant under the
symmetry (both discrete and continuous). They find it a good practice to
choose as a section a plane for which the flow projections maximize the
energy with respect to the L2 norm.

Their \emph{discussion of symmetries} is clear and succinct. Will have
to use all of it.
The generator
of the vertical cyclic symmetry group of order $2n$ is a \emph{glide reflection}
(here eq.~(13)). In eqs.~(31), (32)
they give explicit action of symmetries on the Fourier basis.

Rotation through $\pi$ in is another group
generator, i.e., if $\bu$ is a Kolmogorov flow then
\[
R \bu \to [-u(-x,-y),-v(-x,-y)]
\]
is one also. In all there are $4n$ discrete symmetries group elements.

The remaining symmetry group is the continuous group of translations
in the $x$ direction.

Even though Sirovich\rf{Sirovich87} cites Birkhoff and
MacLane\rf{BirkMacL63} for \emph{glide reflection}, I did not find it in
that book. However, glide reflection is standard, described many
places.

Killingbeck\rf{Killingbeck70} might be
a potentially useful reference (maybe too chemical?)

There are four isometries in the plane: translation, rotation,
reflection, and glide reflection, see \reffig{fig:BaloglouSketch}.
A \emph{reflection} flips points over an invariant axis or line. A
\emph{glide reflection} combines a reflection with a translation along
the direction of the mirror line.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Glide reflections commute with each other, which is not generally the
case for any two given isometries. Given two
congruent sets on the plane, it is in general either a rotation or a
glide reflection -- depending on the orientation between them -- that
maps one to the other. Reflections and non-trivial glide reflections are
mutually exclusive.

The isometry group of a polygon may only consist of rotations and
reflections. In fact only 2 types of such groups are possible, the cyclic
groups \Zn{n} and the dihedral groups \Dn{n} (Leonardo (da Vinci)'s Theorem).
Translations and glide reflections may leave an infinite set invariant
(and presumably a finite set defined on a periodic domain),
see for example \reffig{fig:Baloglou2reflGlides}, taken from notes by
George Baloglou.

\section{Symmetries and isotropy subgroups}
\label{s:KFsymm}
% n00bs.tex
% 2009-06-16 , 16 Jun 2009

\renewcommand{\ssp}{a}


On an infinite domain and in the absence of boundary conditions, the Navier-Stokes
equations are equivariant under any $2D$~translation, $2D$~rotation, and
$\bx \to -\bx$, $\bu \to -\bu$ inversion through the origin\rf{frisch}.
In $2D$ the inversion is the same as rotation by $\pi$.
In Kolmogorov flow, the parallel side walls restrict the rotation
symmetry to rotation by $\pi$ about the $z$-axis. We denote this rotation
by $\sigma_{x}$ and the inversion through the origin by $\sigma_{xy}$.
{The suffixes indicate
which of the homogeneous directions $x,z$ change sign and simplify the
notation for the group algebra of rotation, inversion, and translations
presented in \refsects{s:flipnshift}{s:67-fold}.}
The $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_x$ symmetries generate a discrete dihedral group
$D_1 \times D_1 = \{e,\sigma_x,\sigma_{z},\sigma_{xy}\}$ of order 4, where
\begin{align}
\sigma_x    \, [u,v](x,y) &= [-u,-v,w](-x,-y,z) \nnu \\
\sigma_y    \, [u,v](x,y) &= [u, v,-w](x,y,-z)  \label{sigma}\\
\sigma_{xy} \, [u,v](x,y) &= [-u,-v](-x,-y) \nnu
\,.
\end{align}

The walls also restrict the translation symmetry to $1D$ streamwise
translations. With periodic boundary condition, these translations
become the $\SOn{2}$ continuous one-parameter
group of streamwise translations
\begin{align}
\tau(\shift) [u,v](x,y) &= [u, v](x+\shift, y)
\,.
\label{translation}
\end{align}
The equations of Kolmogorov flow are thus equivariant under the group
$\GPKF = \On{2} \times \Dn{4} = D_{1,x} \ltimes \SOn{2} \times \Dn{4}$,
where $\ltimes$ stands for a semi-direct product, and sign changes in
$x$, and $y$ subscripts indicate spanwise translations and sign changes
in $y$.

The solutions of an equivariant system can satisfy all of the system's
symmetries, a proper subgroup of them, or have no symmetry at all. For a
given solution $\bu$, the subgroup that contains all symmetries that fix
$\bu$ (that satisfy $s \bu = \bu$) is called the isotropy (or stabilizer)
subgroup of $\bu$. \rf{hoyll06,MarRat99, golubitsky2002sp, GL-Gil07b}.
For example, a typical turbulent trajectory $\bu(\bx,t)$ has no symmetry
beyond the identity, so its isotropy group is $\{e\}$. At the other
extreme is the laminar {\eqv}, whose isotropy group is the full
Kolmogorov symmetry group $\GPKF$.

In between, the isotropy subgroup  of most
of the \eqva\ reported here is $S = \{e, s_1, s_2, s_3\}$, where
\begin{align}
s_1 \, [u,v](x,y) &= [u, v, -w](x+L_x/2, y, -z) \nnu \\
s_2 \, [u,v](x,y) &= [-u, -v, w](-x+L_x/2,-y,z+L_y/2) \label{shiftRot}\\
s_3 \, [u,v](x,y) &= [-u,-v,-w](-x, -y, -z+L_y/2) \nnu
\,.
\end{align}
Flow-invariant subgroups might play an important role in the turbulent
dynamics. In this section we provide a partial classification of the
isotropy groups of $\GPKF$, sufficient to classify all currently known
invariant solutions and to guide the search for new solutions with other
symmetries.


\subsection{Flips and half-shifts}
\label{s:flipnshift}

A few observations will be useful in what follows. First, we note the
key role played by the {rotation and reflection} symmetries $\sigma_x$
and $\sigma_y$ \refeq{sigma} in the classification of solutions and
their isotropy groups. The equivariance of Kolmogorov flow under
continuous translations allows for {\reqva} solutions, \ie,
solutions that are steady in a frame moving with a constant velocity
in $(x)$. In {\statesp}, {\reqva} either trace out
circles or wind around tori, and these sets are both
continuous-translation and time invariant. The sign changes under
$\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_{y}$, however, imply particular
centers of symmetry in $x$ and $y$,
and thus fix the translational phase of fields that are fixed by these
symmetries. Thus the presence of $\sigma_x$ or $\sigma_y$ in an
isotropy group prohibits {\reqva} in $x$ or $z$, and the
presence of $\sigma_{xy}$ prohibits any form of {\reqv}. Guided
by this observation, we will seek {\eqva} only for isotropy subgroups
that contain the $\sigma_{xy}$ inversion symmetry.

Second, the periodic boundary conditions impose discrete
translation symmetries of $\tau(L_x, 0)$ and $\tau(0, L_y)$ on
velocity fields. In addition to this full-period translation symmetry,
a solution can also be fixed under a rational translation, such as
$\tau(m L_x/n, 0)$ or a continuous translation $\tau(\ell)$.
If a field is fixed under continuous translation, it is
constant along the given spatial variable. If it is fixed under rational
translation $\tau(m L_x/n, 0)$, it is fixed under $\tau(m L_x/n,
0)$ for $m \in [1, n-1]$ as well, provided that $m$ and $n$ are
relatively prime. For this reason the subgroups of the
continuous translation $\SOn{2}$ consist of the discrete cyclic groups
$\Zn{n}$ for $n=2,3,4,\ldots$ together with the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$
and the full group $\SOn{2}$ itself. For rational
shifts $\ell_x/L_x = m/n$ we simplify the notation a bit by rewriting
\refeq{translation} as
\begin{align}
\trDiscr{x}{m/n} = \tau(m L_x/n, 0)
\,.
\label{translDisc}
\end{align}
Since $m/n = 1/2$ will loom large in what follows, we omit exponents of $1/2$:
\beq
    \trHalf{x} = \trDiscr{x}{1/2}
    \,,\;
    \trHalf{z} = \trDiscr{z}{1/2}
    \,,\;
    \trHalf{xz} = \trHalf{x} \trHalf{z}
\,.
\label{tauHalf}
\eeq
If a field $\bu$ is fixed under a rational shift $\tau(L_x/n)$,
it is periodic on the smaller spatial domain $x \in [0,L_x/n]$.
For this reason we can exclude from our searches all \eqv\
whose isotropy subgroups contain
rational translations in favor of \eqva\ computed on smaller domains.
However, as we need to study bifurcations into
states with wavelengths longer than the initial state,
the linear stability computations
need to be carried out in the full $[L_x,2]$ cell.
For example, if \tEQ{}\ is an \eqv\ solution in the
$\bCell_{1/3}= [L_x/3,2]$ cell, we refer to the
same solution repeated thrice in $\bCell = [L_x,2]$
as ``streamwise-tripled'' or
$3 \times \tEQ{}$. Such solution is by construction fixed under the
$\Zn{3} = \{e,\trDiscr{x}{1/3},\trDiscr{x}{2/3}\}$ subgroup.


Third, some isotropy groups are conjugate to each other under symmetries
of the full group $\GPKF$. Subgroup $H'$ is conjugate to $H$ if there is
an $s \in \GPKF$ for which $H' = s^{-1} H s$. In spatial terms, two
conjugate isotropy groups are equivalent to each other under a coordinate
transformation. A set of conjugate isotropy groups forms a conjugacy
class. It is necessary to consider only a single representative of each
conjugacy class; solutions belonging to conjugate isotropy groups can be
generated by applying the symmetry operation of the conjugacy.

In the present case conjugacies under spatial translation symmetries are
particularly important. Note that $\On{2}$ is not an abelian group, since
reflections $\sigma$ and translations $\tau$ along the same axis do not
commute \rf{Harter93}. Instead we have $\sigma \tau  = \tau^{-1} \sigma$.
Rewriting this relation as $\sigma \tau^{2} = \tau^{-1} \sigma \tau$, we
note that \bea \sigma_x \tau_x(\ell_x, 0)
  &=& \tau^{-1}(\ell_x/2, 0) \, \sigma_x \, \tau(\ell_x/2, 0)
\,.
\label{origShift}
\eea
The right-hand side of \refeq{origShift} is a similarity
transformation that translates the origin of coordinate system. For
$\shift_x = L_x/2$ we have
\beq
\trDiscr{x}{-1/4} \, \sigma_{x} \, \trDiscr{x}{1/4}
        = \sigma_{x} \trHalf{x}
\label{origQuartShift}
\,,
\eeq
and similarly for the spanwise shifts / reflections. Thus for
each isotropy group containing the shift-reflect $\sigma_x \tau_x$
symmetry, there is a simpler conjugate isotropy group in which
$\sigma_x \tau_x$ is replaced by $\sigma_x$ (and similarly
for $\sigma_y \tau_y$ and $\sigma_y$). We choose as the representative
of each conjugacy class the simplest isotropy group, in which all such
reductions have been made. However, if an isotropy group contains both
$\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_x \tau_x$, it cannot be simplified this way,
since the conjugacy simply interchanges the elements.

Fourth, for $\shift_x = L_x$, we have $\trHalf{x}^{-1} \, \sigma_{x} \,
\trHalf{x} = \sigma_x \,,$ so that, in the special case of half-cell
shifts, $\sigma_x$ and $\tau_x$ commute. For the same reason, $\sigma_y$
and $\tau_y$ commute, so the order-16 isotropy subgroup \beq G = D_{1,x}
\times \Zn{2} \times D_{1,z} \times C_{2,z} \subset \GPKF
\ee{order16subgrp} is abelian.


\subsection{The 67-fold path}
\label{s:67-fold}

We now undertake a partial classification
of the lattice of isotropy subgroups of Kolmogorov flow. We focus on
isotropy groups involving at most half-cell shifts, with $\SOn{2} \times \Dn{4}$
translations restricted to order 4 subgroup of spanwise-streamwise
translations \refeq{tauHalf} of half the cell length,
\beq
T = \Zn{2}\times C_{2,z}
  =  \{e,\trHalf{x},\trHalf{z},\trHalf{xz}\}
\,. \label{tauD2} \eeq All such isotropy subgroups of $\GPKF$ are
contained in the subgroup $G$  \refeq{order16subgrp}. Within $G$, we look
for the simplest representative of each conjugacy class, as described
above.


Let us first enumerate all subgroups $\isotropyG{} \subset G$.
The subgroups can be of order
$|\isotropyG{}| = \{1,2,4,8,16\}$.
A subgroup is generated by multiplication of a set of
generator elements, with the choice of
generator elements unique up to a permutation of subgroup
elements.
A subgroup of order $|\isotropyG{}| =  2$ has only one generator,
since every group element is its own inverse. There are 15
non-identity elements in $G$ to choose from, so there are 15 subgroups
of order 2.
Subgroups of order 4 are generated by multiplication of two
group elements. There are 15 choices for the first and 14
choices for the second. However, each order-4 subgroup
can be generated by $3 \cdot 2$ different choices of generators.
For example, any two of $\tau_x, \tau_y, \tau_{xz}$ in any order
generate the same group $T$. Thus there are $(15 \cdot 14)/(3 \cdot 2) = 35$
subgroups of order 4.

Subgroups of order 8 have three generators.  There are
15 choices for the first generator, 14 for the second, and 12 for the
third. There are 12 choices for the third
generator and not  13, since if it were chosen to be the product of the
first two generators, we would get a subgroup of order 4.
Each order-8 subgroup can be generated
by $7 \cdot 6 \cdot 4$ different choices of three generators, so there are
$(15 \cdot 14 \cdot 12)/(7 \cdot 6 \cdot 4) = 15$ subgroups of order 8.
In summary: there is the group $G$ itself, of order 16,
15 subgroups of order 8, 35 of order 4, 15 of
order 2, and 1 (the identity) of order 1,
or 67 subgroups in all \rf{HalcrowThesis}.
This is whole lot of isotropy subgroups to juggle; fortunately,
the observations of \refsect{s:flipnshift} show that there
are only 5 {\em distinct conjugacy classes} in which we can expect
to find \eqva.

The 15 order-2 groups fall into 8 distinct conjugacy
classes, under conjugacies between $\sigma_x \tau_x$ and $\sigma_x$
and $\sigma_y \tau_y$ and $\sigma_y$. These conjugacy classes are
represented by the 8 isotropy groups generated individually by the 8
generators
$\sigma_x,\, \sigma_y,\, \sigma_{xy},\, \sigma_x \tau_y,\,  \sigma_y \tau_x,\,
\tau_x,\, \tau_y,\,$ and $\tau_{xz}$. Of these, the latter three imply
periodicity on smaller domains. Of the remaining five,
$\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_x \tau_y$ allow {\reqva} in $z$,
$\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_y \tau_x$ allow {\reqva} in $x$.
Only a single conjugacy class, represented by the isotropy
group
\beq
  \{e,\sigma_{xy}\}
\,,
\ee{S3subgrp}
breaks both continuous translation symmetries. Thus, of all
order-2  isotropy groups, we expect only this group to have {\eqva}.

Of the 35 subgroups of order 4, we need to identify those that
contain $\sigma_{xy}$ and thus support {\eqva}. We choose
as the simplest representative of each conjugacy class the isotropy
group in which $\sigma_{xy}$ appears in isolation.
Four isotropy subgroups of order 4 are generated by picking
$\sigma_{xy}$ as the first generator, and $\sigma_{z},\, \sigma_{z}
\trHalf{x},\, \sigma_{z} \trHalf{z},\,$ or $\sigma_{z} \trHalf{xz}$
as the second generator (\emph{R} for reflect-rotate):
\begin{align}
 R~~  &=  \{e, \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_{xy}\}
      ~~~~~~~\; = \{e,\sigma_{xy}\} \times \{e,\sigma_{z}\} \nnu\\
 R_x~ &=  \{e,\sigma_x \trHalf{x}, \sigma_y \trHalf{x}, \sigma_{xy}\}
      ~~ = \{e,\sigma_{xy}\} \times \{e,\sigma_{x}\trHalf{x}\}
        \label{subg4RR} \\
 R_y~ &=  \{e, \sigma_x \trHalf{z}, \sigma_y \trHalf{z}, \sigma_{xy}\}
      ~~\; = \{e,\sigma_{xy}\} \times \{e,\sigma_{z}\trHalf{z}\}
        \nnu\\
 R_{xz} &= \{e, \sigma_x \trHalf{xz}, \sigma_y \trHalf{xz}, \sigma_{xy}\}
        = \{e,\sigma_{xy}\} \times \{e,\sigma_{z}\trHalf{xz}\}
        \simeq S \,. \nnu
\end{align}
These are the only isotropy groups of order 4 containing $\sigma_{xy}$
and no isolated translation elements. Together with $\{e,\sigma_{xy}\}$,
these 5 isotropy subgroups represent the 5 conjugacy classes in
which expect to find {\eqva}.


\section{{\StateDsp} visualization}
\label{s:KFvisualStatSp}

\refRef{GHCW07} presents a method for visualizing low-dimensional
projections of trajectories in the infinite-dimensional {\statesp} of the
Navier-Stokes equations. Briefly, we construct an orthonormal basis
$\{\be_1, \be_2, \cdots, \be_n\}$ that spans a set of physically
important fluid states $\bu_A$, $\bu_B$, $\dots$, such as {\eqv} states
and their eigenvectors, and we project the evolving fluid state $\bu(t)$
onto this basis using the $L^2$ inner product \refeq{innerproduct}. This
produces a low-dimensional projection
\beq
\ssp(t) =(\ssp_1, \ssp_2, \cdots, \ssp_n, \cdots)(t)
    \,,\qquad
\ssp_n(t) = (\bu(t), \be_n)
\,,
\ee{intrSspTraj}
which can be viewed in $2d$ planes $\{\be_m, \be_n\}$ or in $3d$
perspective views $\{\be_{\ell},\be_m, \be_n\}$. The {\stateDsp}
portraits are {\em dynamically intrinsic}, since the projections are
defined in terms of intrinsic solutions of the equations of motion, and
{\em representation independent}. Such bases are
effective because moderate-\Reynolds\ turbulence explores a small
repertoire of unstable coherent structures, so that the trajectory $a(t)$
does not stray far from the subspace spanned by the key structures.

There is no {\em a priori} prescription for picking a `good' set of
basis fluid states, and construction of $\{\be_n\}$ set requires
some experimentation. As shown in
\refref{GHCW07}, the dynamics of different regions of {\statesp}
can be elucidated by projections onto basis sets constructed from
combinations of {\eqva} and their eigenvectors.

% ChaosBook \Chapter{symm}{11apr2015}{Discrete symmetry factorization}

A group element $\LieEl\in \Group$ acts on  a function
$\rho(\ssp)$ defined on \statesp\ $\pS$ by its {\em operator representation}
\beq
U(\LieEl)\,\rho(\ssp) = \rho(\matrep{\LieEl}^{-1}\ssp)
\,.
\ee{ActOnFcts}
This is the conventional, Wigner definition of the effect of
transformations.

The Frobenius `character orthogonality' theory of \irrep s
(irreducible representations) of finite groups
says that all invariant
subspaces are obtained by weighted averages (`projections')
\beq
\rho^{(\irreplab)}(\ssp)
    =
\frac{d_\irreplab}{|\Group|} \sum_{\LieEl}
\character{\irreplab}{\LieEl}\,U(\LieEl)\,\rho(\ssp)
    =
\frac{d_\irreplab}{|\Group|} \sum_{\LieEl}
\character{\irreplab}{\LieEl}\,\rho(\matrep{\LieEl^{-1}}\ssp)
\ee{irrepFncts}

The simplest example is afforded by the 1\dmn\ subspace (irrep)
given by the fully symmetrized average of components of the regular basis
function $\rho^{reg}(\ssp)$
\[
\rho^{(A_1)}(\ssp)
    =
 \frac{1}{|\Group|} \sum_{\LieEl}^\Group \rho(\matrep{\LieEl}\,\ssp)
\,.
\]
By construction, $\rho^{(A_1)}$ is invariant under all actions of the group,
\(
U(\LieEl)\,\rho^{(A_1)}(\ssp) = \rho^{(A_1)}(\ssp)
 \,.
\)
This $\rho^{(A_1)}(\ssp)$ invariant subspace is a special case
of \refeq{irrepFncts},
with all $\character{A_1}{\LieEl}=1$.
In other words, for every ${\LieEl}$ this is an eigenvector of the
{\regrep} $\regmatrep{\LieEl}$ with eigenvalue 1.


By now the group acts in many different ways, so let us recapitulate:

  \begin{tabular}{r c l}
    $\LieEl~$ &~~~ & abstract group element, multiplies other elements \\[0.3em]
    $\matrep{\LieEl}$ &~~~ & [$d\!\times\!d$] \statesp\  transformation matrix,
                      multiplies $\ssp\in\pS$ \\[0.3em]
    $U(\LieEl)$ &~~~ & operator,
                acts on functions $\rho(\ssp)$ defined over \statesp\ $\pS$\\[0.3em]
    $\matirrep{\irreplab}{\LieEl}$ &~~~ & [$d_\irreplab\!\times\!d_\irreplab$]
               irrep,  acts on invariant subspace $\rho^{(\irreplab)}(\sspRed)$
  \end{tabular}

Note that the {\statesp} transformation $\matrep{\LieEl} \neq \matrep{e}$
can leave sets of `{\em boundary}' points  invariant (or `invariant
points'); for example, under reflection
$\sigma$ across a symmetry plane, the plane itself remains invariant.

has a
$4$ shift elements and $4$ shift-reflect elementS.
There are $5$ classes:
$\{e\}$,
$\{\trDiscr{}{1/2}\}$,
$\{\trDiscr{}{1/4},\trDiscr{}{3/4}\}$,
$\{\sigma,\sigma\trDiscr{}{1/2}\}$ and
$\{\sigma\trDiscr{}{1/4},\sigma\trDiscr{}{3/4}\}$.
There are four different one-dimensional irreducible representations,
whose characters are $\pm 1$ under reflection $\sigma$ and shift-reflect
operation $\sigma\trDiscr{}{1/4}$.
There is one 2-dimensional representation $e$.
It has 3 subgroups:  \Zn{4},  \Dn{2} and  \Zn{2}.
Life can be made easier by defining the quarter-shift as
$\trDiscr{}{} = \trDiscr{}{1/4}$,
with $\sigma^2=e$, $\trDiscr{}{4}=e$, and
$\sigma\trDiscr{}{}=\trDiscr{}{-1}\sigma$.
The character table is given in \reftab{tab:D4char}.

In this paper we present global views of all invariant solutions in terms

for example \uEQ, projected using the Frobenius character projection
operators \refeq{irrepFncts} on the 4 one-dimensional representations:

    the 1/8-space, with all $\beUBg{1} >0$.

This is a low-dimensional projection intended for visualization. The
dimensionality is lower than the full \statesp, so trajectories can
appear to cross in such projections. We emphasize again that this is one
of many possible projections that can be constructed from linear
combinations of exact solutions, their spatial translations, and their
stability eigenfunctions.
