\chapter{Symmetries of space-time \KSe}
\label{chap:disc_symm}

In this chapter we look at the discrete subgroups of $\On{2} \times
\SOn{2}$ that arise when calculating \twot\ spatiotemporal solutions, and
write up the projection operators algebra needed to restrict the
computations to invariant subspaces. The discussion will be restricted to
solutions that lie in the flow invariant antisymmetric subspace $\bbU^+$,
whose spatiotemporal subgroup is $\Zn{2}\times (e)$, and \ppo s whose
discrete symmetry subgroup is $\Zn{2} \times \Cn{2}$.

This section makes the assumption that one is not in the flow invariant
subspace defined by Golubitsky and Stewart\rf{golubitsky2002sp} and
Gibson, Halcrow and Cvitanovi{\'c}\rf{GHCW07}, and also assumes that
outside of this flow invariant subspace that there are \ppo s. Then one
can calculate the number of active variables much like
%\refsect
{sect:selection\_KS} (?) if one took real valued transforms.
    }

The main results which I'll describe is for $s_1$ and $s_3$ "\ppo
solutions" if they exist, which I couldn't confirm. Think of this as an
algebra check on the previous work if its worthless or not interesting.

For $s_1$ we have $[u,v,w](x,y,z,t) = [u,v,-w](x+\frac{L_x}{2},y,-z,t+\frac{T}{2})$.
The functions $u,v,w$ have generic expansions (i.e. there is a sum over index $m$ that denotes unit directions $\hat{x}_m$ that
I'm not including) given by the following.
\bea
\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t) &=& \sum_{jkn\ell} T_{\ell}(y)[\cos(q_j x)\cos(q_k z)(a_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+b_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& \cos(q_j x)\sin(q_k z)(c_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+d_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& \sin(q_j x)\cos(q_k z)(e_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+f_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& \sin(q_j x)\sin(q_k z)(g_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_nc t)+h_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))]
\eea
applying symmetry operation $\tau s_1$ results in (with trigonometric identities and parity of functions)
\bea
u(\mathbf{x},t) &=& \sum_{jkn\ell} T_{\ell}(y)[(-1)^{j+n}\cos(q_j x)\cos(q_k z)(a_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+b_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& (-1)^{j+n+1}\cos(q_j x)\sin(q_k z)(c_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+d_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& (-1)^{j+n}\sin(q_j x)\cos(q_k z)(e_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+f_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& (-1)^{j+n+1}\sin(q_j x)\sin(q_k z)(g_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+h_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))]
\eea
which results in the selection rules that $j+n$ must be even for the terms $a_{jkn\ell},b_{jkn\ell},e_{jkn\ell},f_{jkn\ell}$ and
$j+n$ must be odd for $c_{jkn\ell},d_{jkn\ell},g_{jkn\ell},h_{jkn\ell}$ for terms in the sums to be non-zero. These selection rules
also apply to the $v$ component of the velocity field, but they switch for the $w$ component due to the extra $-1$ that results from
$s_1$ symmetry operation.

For $j+n$ to be even, they either both half to be even, or both have to be odd, which reduces the number of terms in the summation
by a factor of $4$. Likewise, $j+n$ to be odd, the indices $j,n$ need to either be odd,even or even,odd pairs; again reducing the number
of terms in the summation by a factor of four. Therefore by imposing this type of symmetry and having an spatiotemporal discretization
only increases the dimensionality of the problem by a factor of $N_t / 4$, making it more manageable memory wise.

For solutions with invariant under $\tau s_3$ we have
\[
[u,v,w](x,y,z,t) = [-u,-v,-w](-x,-y,-z+\frac{L_z}{2},t+\frac{T}{2})
\,,
\]
using the parity of Chebyshev polynomials (because this transformation includes
changes to y), trigonometric identities, and parity of sine and cosine functions, we get
\bea
u(\mathbf{x},t) &=& \sum_{jkn\ell} T_{\ell}(y)[(-1)^{l+k+n+1}\cos(q_j x)\cos(q_k z)(a_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+b_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& (-1)^{l+k+n}\cos(q_j x)\sin(q_k z)(c_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+d_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& (-1)^{l+k+n}\sin(q_j x)\cos(q_k z)(e_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+f_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& (-1)^{l+k+n+1}\sin(q_j x)\sin(q_k z)(g_{jkn\ell}\cos(w_n t)+h_{jkn\ell}\sin(w_n t))]
\,,
\eea
where the selection rules are identical for each component of the velocity field because the symmetry transformation changes the sign
on all of the components. Because the result has the same requirement but over three indices I believe that this just reduces the number
of variables by a factor of $8$, so including a time dimension only increases the dimensionality by a factor of $8$.

\subsection{Selection Rules for \Cn{n} shift-reflection symmetries in Kolmogorov flow}
I've been working towards two dimensional Kolmogorov flow code and I realized that it
was imperative to figure out the symmetry invariant subspace related for shift reflection where
the shift is not a half domain but rather a cyclic shift of order $n$ as determined by the forcing
profile in the doubly periodic domain of numerical simulations.

Because the algebra get's exceedingly long I'll present the final result for the selection rules
as the equivalent problem of finding the kernel of a matrix operator. The idea is to work
completely with the vorticity field $\omega(x,y,t)$, which has symmetries of n-cell shift and
spatial reflection, as well as rotation by $\pi$. Specifically shift reflection on a spatial domain
$x \in [0,2\pi]$ and $y \in [0,2\pi]$, with forcing profile of $n$ cells is given by,

\beq
\omega (x,y,t) \rightarrow -\omega (-x,y+\frac{\pi}{n},t)
\eeq

and the rotation is given by,

\beq
\omega (x,y,t) \rightarrow \omega (-x,-y,t) \,.
\eeq

By using applying the invariance condition only for shift-reflection invariant (three) tori solutions, we start
with the expansion for the scalar field in terms of the real-valued Fourier basis functions.

\bea
\omega(x,y,t) &=& \sum_{jkn} [\cos(q_j x)\cos(q_k y)(a_{jkn}\cos(w_n t)+b_{jkn}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& \cos(q_j x)\sin(q_k y)(d_{jkn}\cos(w_n t)+f_{jkn}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& \sin(q_j x)\cos(q_k y)(g_{jkn}\cos(w_n t)+h_{jkn}\sin(w_n t))\continue
                        &+& \sin(q_j x)\sin(q_k y)(m_{jkn}\cos(w_n t)+p_{jkn}\sin(w_n t))]
\eea
If we assume there are preperiodic solutions under ($\ell$)-cell shift
reflection after a prime period $\period{p}$, the general selection rules can be
written as constraint conditions
\bea
a_{jkn} &=&  (-1)^{n+1}[a_{jkn}\cos(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})-b_{jkn}\sin(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})] \continue
b_{jkn} &=&  (-1)^{n}[a_{jkn}\cos(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})-b_{jkn}\sin(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})] \continue
d_{jkn} &=&  (-1)^{n}[d_{jkn}\cos(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})+f_{jkn}\sin(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})] \continue
f_{jkn} &=&  (-1)^{n}[-d_{jkn}\cos(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})+f_{jkn}\sin(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})] \continue
g_{jkn} &=&  (-1)^{n+1}[g_{jkn}\cos(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})+h_{jkn}\sin(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})] \continue
h_{jkn} &=&  (-1)^{n}[g_{jkn}\cos(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})-h_{jkn}\sin(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})] \continue
m_{jkn} &=&  (-1)^{n}[m_{jkn}\cos(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})+p_{jkn}\sin(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})] \continue
p_{jkn} &=&  (-1)^{n}[-m_{jkn}\cos(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})+p_{jkn}\sin(\frac{q_k \pi}{\ell})]
\eea

By doing some algebra one realizes that the coefficients are zero unless
$k_y$ the wavenumber associated with the direction that the forcing
profile varies over is only nonzero for integer multiples of the forcing
wavelength. In other words, if the forcing repeats four times, the only
nonzero $k_y$ are $k_y = 4,8,12, \cdots$. The way that the preperiodic
(time) condition comes into play is just like how it comes into play in
the \KSe\ equation, half of the modes are zero depending on whether the
time index $n$ is even or odd. Specifically, the modes that are zero are,

For $k_y$ being an odd number of multiples of the forcing profile index
$\ell$, we have the following constraints
\bea
d_{jkn},f_{jkn},m_{jkn},p_{jkn} &=& 0 \, \mbox{for}\, n \, \mbox{odd} \continue
a_{jkn},b_{jkn},g_{jkn},h_{jkn} &=& 0 \, \mbox{for}\, n \, \mbox{even}
\eea

For $k_y$ being an even number of multiples of the forcing profile index
$\ell$, we have the following constraints
\bea
d_{jkn},f_{jkn},m_{jkn},p_{jkn} &=& 0 \, \mbox{for}\, n \, \mbox{even} \continue
a_{jkn},b_{jkn},g_{jkn},h_{jkn} &=& 0 \, \mbox{for}\, n \, \mbox{odd}
\eea

Of course for \eqva\ this simplifies due to not having a third continuous
dimension, and we only have four distinct sets of coefficients
(combinations of $\sin$ and $\cos$ in $x,y$). In fact, it simplifies even
more due to not having the extra factor $-1^n$, such that the only
non-zero coefficients
\bea
a_{jk},b_{jk} &=& 0 \, \mbox{for}\, k_y \, \mbox{even multiple of forcing index} \continue
d_{jk},f_{jk} &=& 0 \, \mbox{for}\, k_y \, \mbox{odd multiple of forcing index} \continue
\eea

In summary, for \eqva\ with discrete shift reflection symmetry, the number of non-zero
modes equals $N_x*\frac{N_y}{2*\ell}$ and for preperiodic orbits it totals $N_x*\frac{N_y}{\ell}*\frac{N_t}{2}$.

Note, this is also useful for the \KSe\ if one desires the selection
rules for $\ell$ cyclic shift reflection, as there is no difference
between shift reflection in two continuous spatial dimensions versus one
space and one time; the analogy is perfect with $y$ playing the role of
$t$ in the \KSe.
