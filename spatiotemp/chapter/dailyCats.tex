There has been some progress in the cat maps direction. Li did a simple
simulation for single cat map which has  confirmed my guesses so far.
General question is about 2D symbolic dynamics which we used in our paper
with Vladimir\rf{GutOsi15}. We encoded trajectories by   winding numbers so the
alphabet is small. This radically   differs  from standard symbolic
dynamics - Markov partitions, etc. which you normally  find in the
literature.

Question: Given  rectangular domain of symbols - what is
the probability  to  find it within a generic N-particle {\catlatt}
trajectory of duration T (N and T are large)? To my surprise  an answer
for this question might be within reach  (at least for most of the
sequences, small rectangles, etc.) This symbolic dynamics is much nicer
then what I thought it would be. If true, this will be a nice project for
students. I am writing some notes, will send this  crude staff at night
today - hopefully it will be  digestible.

The downside the \PV\rf{PerViv} `linear code' is that the Markov/generating
partition is infinite, meaning that for longer and longer orbits there are
more and more new pruning (inadmissible {\brick s}) rules, ad infinitum.

As far as I can tell, for $N$ coupled maps this gets harder to describe,
as in general there is an coupling strength parameter. Perhaps for rational
values of it some miracles might happen.

Before I start sounding critical: Rana, Adrien and Li are all good
students / postdoc, and the work and what people learned this summer is
very good. Now, to my first impressions (Boris still has to chime in, and
we should all meet soon to discuss).

Boris was the primary advisor for Adrien and Rana, and he did not push
them to write; European style, more hands off than is the American
custom. Rana has written too little, not covering all the work that she
did (which was good, but only Boris knows what it was). Adrien also has
some work to do before the report can be read by anyone other than the
members of this team.

For me, what lacks in Rana, Adrien and Li's work is that they did not
(on their own initiative) read the literature, or if they did, they never
summarized what they learned in their blogs, or cited the original
sources in their reports (if it is not recorded, I assume it did not
happen). I did an exhaustive literature search for them (for coupled
maps, see above in this blog, \refchap{chap:dailyCats}; for cat maps see
\refsect{sect:ArnCatLit} and \refsect{c-appendStatM}), but they did not
pick it up, so I'll have to do that work myself.

{\em Information content and predictability of lumped and distributed
dynamical systems}
``
... we point out the difference between difficulty and possibility of
forecasting, illustrating it with quadratic maps. Next, we ask ourselves how
this should be generalized to distributed, spatially extended and homogeneous
systems. We point out that even the basic concepts of how information is
processed by such systems are unknown. Finally, we discuss some
intermittency-like effects in coupled maps and cellular automata.

Most interesting systems are spatially extended (``distributed'')
and have thus, in the infinite-volume limit, an infinite number
of degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, concepts developed for
dynamical system with few degrees of freedom can be
applied.

Let us first consider a system located in a finite space
volume V with fixed boundary conditions. For the moment
we assume that the field variables (local observables) are
continuous, while space and time are discrete.

It is very plausible that the number of excited degrees of freedom in such a
system is proportional to the volume, at least in typical situations. More
precisely, we expect that both the metric entropy h and the dimension D are
extensive quantities. This is supported by overwhelming
theoretical\rf{ruelext,FMTT83,Nicolaenko86} and numerical evidence that the
Lyapunov exponents (ordered such that 2, decreases with i) scale as
\beq
\Lyap_i \approx f( i/V )

The limit
\(
\eta = \lim_{V\to\infty}(h/V)

more interesting is the
information needed to describe a finite part of an infinite

{On the stability of periodic orbits of two-dimensional mappings}: ``
We apply our criterion and derive a sufficient stability condition for a
large class of periodic orbits of the widely studied ``standard mapping''

''

I find this paper quite interesting, because the computation of Floquet
multipliers, \ie, linearization of periodically `kicked' free rotor, is full
of matrices that look like Laplacians + a diagonal term which varies along
the periodic orbit. For cat maps this term is constant, essentially the
stretching factor $s$. This might help with interpreting coupled `kicked'
rotor lattices.

This is presumably related to the block circulant stability
matrices\rf{AGGN91,GadAmr93} for spatially and temporally periodic orbits

$x_{n,t}$, $y_{n,t}$ from $x_n$ with odd or even $n$, and obtain a 2D lattice
symmetric under $(x,y) \leftrightarrow (y,x)$. Then the symmetric and
asymmetric spaces behave differently. In particular, the second

Belykh and Mosekilde\rf{BelMos96} is a descendent of the system previously
studied by Reick and Mosekilde\rf{ReiMos95} in {\em Emergence of
quasiperiodicity in symmetrically coupled, identical period-doubling
systems}: `` When two identical period-doubling systems are coupled
symmetrically, the period-doubling transition to chaos may be replaced by a
quasiperiodic transition. The reason for this is that at an early stage of
the period-doubling cascade, a Hopf bifurcation instead of a period-doubling
bifurcation occurs. Our main result is that the emergence of this Hopf
bifurcation is a generic phenomenon in symmetrically coupled, identica1
period-doubling systems. The whole phenomenon is stable against small
nonsymmetric perturbations. Our results cover maps and differential equations
of arbitrary dimension. As a consequence the Feigenbaum transition to chaos
in these coupled systems - which exists, but tends to be unstable - is
accompanied by an infinity of Hopf bifurcations.''

The seemingly first remark on this splitting is due to Ruelle\rf{Ruelle73NY}.
He noted that the symmetry of the coupling results in a splitting into a
symmetric solution and a nonsymmetric solution, where for the latter the two
subsystems are 180' out of phase. Later Neu\rf{Neu79,Neu79a} specialized the
problem to linear coupling and analyzed the stability of the symmetric and
nonsymmetric solutions by singular perturbation methods.

All of these might be of importance for Burak's torus birth and
destruction\rf{BudCvi15}.

As for the cats crowd, these seem to suggest that spacetime interchange
symmetry $t \leftrightarrow n$ of the {\catlatt}\rf{GHJSC16}
should lead to different dynamics (and symbolic dynamics! only positive
$(n,t)$ are needed after the decomposition) in symmetrized and
anti-symmetrized lattices, with a possible flow-invariant subspace currently
invisible. In Gibson, Halcrow and Cvitanovi{\'c}\rf{GHCW07} {\em Visualizing
the geometry of state-space in plane {Couette} flow} we also had a
$\Dn{1}\times\Dn{1}$ symmetry, with important consequences on types of
solutions, and invariant subspaces.

Having a variational principle (action \refeq{GutOsi15-3.1:model} in case at
hand) and a continuous symmetry means that the \textbf{Noether's theorem} applies

``To every one-parameter, continuous group of symmetries of a Lagrangian
dynamical system there corresponds a scalar, real-valued conserved quantity.''

Is there is a version of it for discrete translations? What is the conserved
quantity for a single cat map? What is it for the lattice? Internet says
many contradictory things:

``The fact that a Lagrangian is unchanged by a discrete transformation  is of
no significance. There is no conserved quantity associated with the
transformation.''

``For infinite symmetries like lattice translations the conserved quantity is
continuous, albeit a periodic one. So in such case momentum is conserved
modulo vectors in the reciprocal lattice. The conservation is local just as
in the case of continuous symmetries.''

Just as an integral of a total divergence depends only on the boundary data,
so does the sum over lattice domain of a total difference.''

She states the discrete {Noether's} Theorem, and in Example 1.3.7  she shows
that for a discretization of a standard mechanical Lagrangian, time
invariance3 yields ``energy'' as a the conserved quantity.

Hydon and Mansfield\rf{HydMan11}.

Capobianco and Toffoli\rf{CapTof11} {Can anything from {Noether's} Theorem be
salvaged for discrete dynamical systems?} is fun to read (but ultimately
unsatisfactory):

``
we take the Ising spin model with both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds. We show that-and why-
energy not only acts as a generator of the dynamics for this family of
systems, but is also conserved when the dynamics is time-invariant.''

The \emph{microcanonical Ising model} is strictly deterministic and
invertible: on a given step, a spin will flip (that is, reverse its
orientation) if and only if doing so will leave the sum of the potential
energies of the four surrounding bonds unchanged. The Ising dynamics is a
second-order recurrence relation. They define ``energy'' as the length of the
boundary between `up' and `down' domains. While the magnetization-number of
spins up minus number of spins down-may change with time, that length, and
thus the energy, remains constant. The total energy of a system may be
defined as
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A real-valued function of the system's state,
  \item that is additive,
  \item and is a generator of the dynamics.
\end{enumerate}
In a discrete Hamiltonian dynamics, a state is no longer a
``position/momentum'' pair $<q,p>$ as in the continuous case, but an ordered
pair of configurations $<q_0,q_1>$.

A second-order dynamical system
has an evolution rule of the form

{\bf \catLatt} claim retracted:

On the second thought, \catlatt\ is not radically different from the previous
examples of ($D$+1)\dmn\ {\spt} symbolic dynamics cited by Boris
(Pesin and Sinai\rf{PesSin88},
Bunimovich and Sinai\rf{BunSin88},
Pethel, Corron and
Bollt\rf{PetCorBol06,PetCorBol07}).
In all coupled maps literature, the starting point is time evolution of a
non-interacting particle at each site, with its 1\dmn\ temporal symbolic
dynamics, with spatial coupling to $D$ spatial neighbors subsequently tacked
on. While the \emph{coordinate} of site is ($D$+1)\dmn, its symbolic dynamics
is 1\dmn. In all models the I am aware of, with the exception of zeta
functions in $d=2$, the field being discretized (``particles'' at sites) is
\emph{scalar}, and so is the \catlatt\ field (I was wrong when I claimed in a
conversation with Boris that is a \emph{vector} field). In $d$ {\spt}
dimensions it is $d$\dmn, but its symbolic dynamics alphabet at each site is
$1$\dmn\ set.

The zeta functions in $d=2$, reviewed in \refchap{chap:zeta2D}, are not based
on any dynamics, and have problems of their own. In nutshell, for such zeta
functions grammars are awkward, while in the \catlatt\ the grammar rules are
automatically obeyed by any simulation, and can be explicitly computed as a
finite set of rules for any given \twot.

Mostly agree, but linear code has its own charm: internal part of the code
has trivial grammar rules, it is very homogeneous, \ie, admissible sequences
of finite length have  volumes either close to zero or close to max (volumes
of internal sequences).

\noindent{\bf Boris 2017-02-17}
For $p$  iterations of the map situation rapidly improves - number of internal
symbols grows exponentially with $p$, number of external symbols is fixed (kind
of renormalization).
\\{\bf Predrag 2017-03-04} That's just a cheat.
For a piecewise linear expanding map of mod~1 variety, it is always the orbit
of the outermost critical point (in your language, exterior alphabet) that
defines the grammar, in the spirit of the kneading theory, with no grammar
rules for the interior alphabet, see ChaosBook chapter {\em Deterministic
diffusion}. If one looks at iterates of the map, of course the number of
interior alphabet sequences grows exponentially, but that does not mean that
they dominate the topological entropy - that ones is what it is, an
irrational number larger than $\ln N_{\Ai}$, the same number for the original
map or any of its iterates.

{\em Networks of planar Hamiltonian systems}
writes things we probably disagree with:

``Hamiltonian systems famously do not admit attractors,  but rather families of
periodic orbits parameterised by level sets of the Hamiltonian.  There have
been surprisingly few attempts to study complex networks consisting of
coupled Hamiltonian systems.
Consequently, in this paper we initiate the study of complex networks whose
autonomous units are planar Hamiltonian systems.  We choose to focus on
planar Hamiltonian systems because already there exists a rich theory that
may be identified with the geometry of planar algebraic curves.

Define a weighted graph $\mathcal{G}$ by assigning
a vertex to each $i \in V$ and an edge with ``weight'' $W_{ij} = W(i,j)$
joining vertex $i$ to $j$. We assume this graph $\mathcal{G}$ is {\em
undirected} (i.e., $W_{ij} = W_{ji}$) and {\em connected} meaning that there
always exists a path from any vertex $i$ to any other vertex $j$. The network
is then defined to be the dynamical system on $\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ whose
time evolution is governed by the equations
\[ \dot{z}_i = F_i(z_i) + \sum_{j=1}^n W_{ij} U(z_i,z_j) \ . \]
We will actually only be concerned with
networks where the autonomous units are planar ($m = 2$) and the coupling
function is {\em diffusive}, implying $U(z_i,z_j) = U(z_i - z_j)$.
We say that a network is an {\em oscillator network} if
each of the underlying systems $\dot{z_i} = F_i(z_i)$ admits at least one
periodic solution.
''

This work is inspired by Winfree, Kuramoto and Turing (rather than coupled
maps lattices). If the dynamics on a node is the same everywhere, the network
(graph) is ``homogenous'', otherwise it is ``heterogenous.'' The diffusive
coupling $W_{ij}=W_{ji}$ couples all nodes, in his model with the same
strength, but the nodes are assumed heterogenous. After further reading it
seems that the networks are not Hamiltonian (coupling destroys that, and that
we can safely avoid this literature.

Rest in pacem.

Our recent\rf{AGBWG18} {\em Semiclassical prediction of large
spectral fluctuations in interacting kicked spin chains}, \arXiv{1709.03601},
hides a feline creature in the form of \refeq{eq:po:deltaQint}:

\noindent
``{\bf Integrable Case}:
%\label{sec:po:int}
For  \(b^x\! = \! 0\) all rotations are around the \(z\)-axis and therefore
commute with the Hamiltonian making the system integrable. As a result the
dynamics of the kicked system for arbitrary times is equivalent to one at fixed
time, \eg \(T\! = \! 1\) with rescaled system parameters \(J\to JT\) and \(b^z\to
b^z T\). Moreover, the flow induced by the Hamiltonian $ \hat{H}_I+ \hat{H}_K$  for time
$T$ is identical to the evolution of the kicked system for \(T\) time steps
with the same parameters.

%Therefore, the momenta form the action variables of the integrable system
%restricting the angles \(\vec{q}\) to a \(L\) dimensional subspace.
For the classical trajectories $p_n=\text{const.}$ holds for each $n$ and
periodic orbits form \(L\) dimensional manifolds.
% All trajectories in this subspace are equivalent with respect to their
% dynamic properties. If for certain values of \(\vec{p}\) a periodic orbit
% exists it is therefore a \(L\) dimensional manifold.
To close a trajectory in phase-space after \(T\) iterations it is sufficient
that the total change in angles \(\Delta q_n\) is a multiple of \(2\pi\),
\beq
 \Delta q_n=4 T\left(J (p_{n-1}+p_{n+1})+ 2V p_n \right)+2b^z T=2\pi \hat{m}_n\,.
\ee{eq:po:deltaQint}
The \(\hat{m}_n\in\mathds{Z}\) is a local winding number for spin \(n\). Since the
momenta are bounded, \(|p_n|\leq 1\),   \(\chi_n\! = \! p_{n-1}+p_{n+1}\) resides
within the interval $[-2,+2]$. Therefore, this equation  has no solution if,
for instance, \(b^z>4(J\!+\!V )\) and \(4(J+V )+b^z<\pi/T\). In such cases
the system does not posses any classical periodic orbits of period \(T\) or
shorter. If all parameters (times \(T\)) are sufficiently small, the first
accessible winding number is necessarily zero. With increasing time $T$ the
number of possible \(\hat{m}_n\) grows linearly, and with it the number of possible
distinct periodic orbits grows algebraically.
% In contrast to the other cases time in the integrable case can be seen as a
% scaling factor of the system parameters, making arbitrary real times
% accessible.
With respect to \(L\) the number of periodic orbits is determined by all
admissible combinations of the winding numbers. If there is more than one
allowed \(m_n\) the growth is thus exponential in \(L\). This exponential
growth also holds for non-integrable parameter choices.
''

Boris continues:
This is the (dual) equation for ``spatially'' periodic orbits of an  integrable
spin chain.  For $4JT=2\pi$ it is the cat map
\beq
p_{n+1} - s\,p_n + p_{n-1}=-{m}_n
\,,
\ee{eq:po:deltaQint1}
with the cat map ``stretching'' parameter $s=-{2TV}/{\pi}$, and the winding number
$m_n= {b^z T}/{\pi} - \hat{m}_n \in \integers$.
For other times T, the map is non-symplectic but still linear. The equation
says, loudly, that  temporally integrable system can be ``spatially" chaotic
(e.g., number of spatial \po s grows exponentially with the spatial period $L$
(in case at hand, the number of ``particles'').

On the quantum side the corresponding ``dual" evolution is  exactly the quantum cat
map.

    \PCpost{2017-10-10}{
Thanks for pointing it out, I would have never noticed that the very feline
\refeq{eq:po:deltaQint1} is hiding within \refeq{eq:po:deltaQint}. So, whenever
one has the nearest neighbor couplings, spatially, spatial translation
invariance, a spatial reflection symmetry, and a linear dynamics on the site,
one gets a spatial cat map. Your $\period{}=1$ example is the discrete time
analog of the Michelson\rf{Mks86} $\period{}=0$ study of \eqva\ on the \ks\
spatial $L\to\pm\infty$ (described in the parallel \texttt{blog.tex}, in this

constant).

We consider directed networks (also known as directed graphs or digraphs)
with set N of nodes (also known as vertices) and set E of directed edges
(also known as links). We suppose that there is at most one edge from a
node m to a node n, and denote the edge by mn. There can also be an edge
from n to m. Each edge carries a weight $w_{mn} > 0$. This can represent
the strength of the edge. We write wmn = 0 if there is no edge from m to
n and we assemble the wmn into a matrix W. The edge weights could be set
to 1, as is common in the literature, and the array W is then called the
adjacency matrix A of the network, but the ability to represent the
strength of the edge is a useful extension. If there were multiple edges
from m to n then we would amalgamate them into a single edge by adding
the weights. Self-edges mm (also called loops) are permitted.

The \emph{weight} of the node n is

  \Lambda h = v
\]
This always has a solution but it is non-unique, because one can add an
arbitrary constant in each connected component of the network. Etc.

They seek levels to minimise the \emph{trophic confusion} :)

A directed network is said to be normal if its
weight matrix ${W}$ commutes with its transpose $\transp{W}$ :
\[
  W\transp{W} = \transp{W}W
\]
Note that $\transp{W}$ represents the same weighted network but
with all the edges reversed.
                                                \toCB
The term ``normal'' came
from people who spent their lives with self-adjoint operators
and unitary operators, both of which are normal, but people
working in stability of ordinary differential equations are fully
cognizant that most matrices are not normal.

For the unweighted case of an adjacency matrix A, normality
implies the imbalance vector v = 0. This is because
$(\transp{A}A)_{mn}$ is the number of sources in common to nodes m and
n, and $(A\transp{A})_{mn}$ is the number of sinks in common. In particular,
$(\transp{A}A)_{nn}= w_n^{in}$
and $(A\transp{A})_{nn}= w_n^{out}$, so $\transp{A}A=A\transp{A}$
implies that $w^{in} = w^{out}$ and v = 0.
When v = 0 we say a network is balanced.

Another special case of normality is symmetric networks $ \transp{W}=W$.

Normality of ${W}$ is equivalent to existence of a unitary
matrix U such that $U^\dagger{W}U$ is diagonal.

A cycle in a directed network is a closed walk in it. We allow repeated
edges and repeated nodes. In particular, we allow a cycle to be a
periodic repetition of a shorter cycle. The weight w of a cycle is the
product of the weights along its edges.
The total weight of cycles of length p is given by the
trace of the $p$th power of W: $\tr{W}^p$.

                                                \toCB
The {\orbit}s are those which are
not repetitions of a shorter cycle. We consider two {\orbit}s to
be the same if they differ only by a cyclic permutation. We denote
by ${\cal P}$ the set of {\orbit}s,
\[
  \zetatop(z) = \prod_p (1-z^\cl{p}w_p)
\]
This can be reduced to one in terms of \PCedit{``elementary cycles''},
those which do not repeat a node before closing. They are prime
and for a finite network there are only finitely many of them. The
formula is
\[
  \zetatop(z) = 1 + \sum_C\prod_{p\in C} (-z^\cl{p}w_p)
\]
where the sum is over non-empty collections C of disjoint elementary
cycles. Might want to study MacKay's proof to see if it is better than
what is in ChaosBook.

{\em Effective Field Theory for Chaotic CFTs}
``    \toVideo{youtu.be/zkOihsqBtGI}
Relations between chaos and hydrodynamics are one of the unique feature
of holographic CFTs. The early time Lyapunov regime can described by an
effective field theory of a single mode, which for maximally chaotic
systems is an hydrodynamic mode. We describe that effective field theory
for conformal field theories, both in two dimensions and in higher
dimensions, and show how it captures maximal chaos and pole skipping. We
discuss the relation of the theory to other formulations of CFTs and show
how it captures interesting objects such as conformal blocks and partial
waves. We speculate on what is needed to extend the discussion to non
maximal chaos.

\arXiv{1709.08222}
2-body scattering is a sub-calculation in the 3-body scattering.

``Wrap-around effects'' arise from finite temporal size of the lattice.

The cleanest example is $\pi^+\pi^+\pi^+$ ellastic scattering. Lattice
simulation data are surprisingly sharp. They are close to 3
non-interacting pions. The agreement with the determinant zeros (infinite
volume limit) using only 2-body scattering date, no fit are very sharp.
So the 3-body contact term will be small (they are working on that now)

The stability operator turns out to be a Dirac like (and not
Schr\"odinger like) operator, with spectrum which covers the entire line.
Yet, we wrote a similar expression  for its regularized determinant and
the Maslov index turns out to be the excess of negative eigenvalues. The
phase space representation is of dimension (1+1)  (not in your sense) but
still it might be related by some miracle/good reason???

We show that it is possible to do numerical calculations in elementary

discretizing both time and space, and summing paths through matrix
multiplication. We give numerical results for various one-dimensional

approximately 100 times longer than with standard methods, but there are
other problems for which such an approach should be more efficient.

a Gaussian spreading in time, but here time is taken to $\infty$...

Can you give a presentation here in Nottingham? The subject of Fritz

\item[2021-10-11 Predrag]

A half? That would kill you, my talk was at 1.0 deciProsen. You are
pleading for milliProsens, I assume. I make no promises in that
spatiotemporal direction.

I would like to give a technical talk, because you guys have a lot of
experience with Laplacians, and I'm puzzled.

{My schedule}
is pretty flexible, and I do not mind getting up at 1:30am (for the
pleasure of being slapped around by Toma\v{z} Prosen, to give a random
example. Or Bogomolny).

For the people who would rather just be entertained, I would suggest
listening to one of the talks on
\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/overheads/spatiotemporal/} {overheads/Spatiotemporal}.
Thanks to my graduate students (yet another level of
paper-writing reluctant) there are no papers to read :-(

\item[2021-09-23 Martin]
A question: Is there an intuitive reason why the Klein-Gordon equation
shows up? Why not something first order, for example? Either like the
eikonal equation or better something linear like Dirac? There is probably
a very simple answer to this but I was just wondering. Is there a
geometrical reason, for example? Nothing of urgency, otherwise I would
have shouted earlier.

\item[2021-10-11 Predrag]
That will precisely be the technical part: Klein-Gordon shows up because
of the nearest neighbor coupling, and it has to be second order because
of the reflection symmetry, so Laplacian. So far, we have only looked at
the Euclidean version, to keep things as simple as possible.  Yes, we can
take the "square root" of Laplacian and get two 1st order, time-asymmetric
equations and a factorized Hill determinant, but I am not sure what to
make of it. So far the field theory is only a scalar, single field
component per site. I'm very reluctant to get into Dirac spin-1/2 fields at
this time, because of lattice no-go-theorems, and the usual fermion
nonsense in lattice formulationsâ€¦
