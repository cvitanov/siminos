The Kolmogorov flow domain $(x,y)\in [0,2\pi]\times [0,2\pi]$ in
\refeq{eq:kolmogorov} really bugs me. The Rayleigh number controls the
viscosity legth scale, as compared to the strip width. Experimentally one
fixes the number $n$ of spanwise strips, and can chose any streamwise
length, so the domain should be a rectangle, such that for given $n$ and
$Re$ if one doubles the streamwise length, on doubles the number of
vortices, while keeping their shape intact. Forcing them  into a square
domain would squash the vortices. 3rd floor people must have thought all
this through...

$I[\mathbf u]$ denote the energy input for the state $\mathbf u$. For
Kolmogorov flow, the energy input $I[\mathbf u]$ is linear in $\mathbf

any symmetry action, we have $I[\mathcal P\mathbf u]=I[\mathbf u]$.
Therefore, $$I[\mathbf u-\mathcal P\mathbf u]=0,$$ that is all the
contribution to the energy input comes solely from the projection
$\mathcal P\mathbf u$!

\subsection{Kolmogorov Flow doubly periodic formulation}

The equations governing two dimensional Kolmogorov flow can be written in terms
of velocity field $\mathbf{u}$(eliminated later) and vorticity $\omega$ in the
following manner. For now I will just write the homogeneous equations, with
forcing easily added afterwards

\beq
\omega_t - \hat{z}\cdot(\nabla \times (\mathbf{u}\times \omega \hat{z})) - \frac{1}{Re}\nabla^2 \omega = 0
\eeq

The only difficult part of rewriting this equation in terms of $(2+1)$ spatiotemporal Fourier coefficients
(assuming periodic boundary conditions) is the nonlinear term, not only due to the cross products
but the necessity to express the velocity field in terms of the streamfunction, and consequently the
vorticity field as $\mathbf{u} = \nabla \times (\nabla^{-2} \omega)$
which is possible due to the two dimensional approximation. The operator $\nabla^{-2}$ is the inverse
of the Laplacian, which is technically singular; I asked around and the standard practice is to essentially
define it in fourier space as $\frac{1}{|\mathbf{k}|^2}$, where $|\mathbf{k}|^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2$. For
numerical purposes its apparently common practice to say that the inverse of the $k_x = k_y = 0 $
term equals $1$. In other words, $1/0 = 1$. It's just a means of approximating the operator in
spectral space.

Although \rf{ChaKer12} give nice formula that is almost entirely of Fourier coefficients, I find it
more useful to completely eliminate the velocity field components $\mathbf{u} = (u,v)$ from the equation.

Therefore, the pseudospectral (homogeneous) spatiotemporal equation takes the form,

\bea \label{eqn:2DK_spectral}
\ii \omega \Omega &+& \ii k_x \mathcal{F}[\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\frac{\ii k_y}{|\mathbf{k}|^2} \Omega)* \mathcal{F}^{-1}(\Omega)] \continue
                  &-& \ii k_y \mathcal{F}[\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\frac{\ii k_x}{|\mathbf{k}|^2} \Omega)*\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\Omega)] \continue
                  &-& \frac{|\mathbf{k}|^2}{Re} \Omega = G(\Omega,T,L_x,L_y) = 0
\eea

Likewise, if allowed to write differentiation operators via $D_t,D_x,D_y$, etc, then the jacobian
takes on the form in pseudospectral representation,

\bea \label{eqn:2DK_spectral_jac}
J   &=& D_t + D_x \mathcal{F}[diag(D_y \nabla^{-2} \omega)\mathcal{F}^{-1} + diag(\omega)D_y \nabla^{-2}\mathcal{F}^{-1}]\continue
    &-& D_y \mathcal{F}[diag(D_x \nabla^{-2} \omega)\mathcal{F}^{-1} + diag(\omega)D_x \nabla^{-2}\mathcal{F}^{-1}] \continue
    &-& \frac{\nabla^2}{Re}
\eea

By taking the complex conjugate and multiplying by the Feynman equation \refeq{eqn:2DK_spectral},
the expression for the adjoint descent direction, $-J^{\dagger}G$.

\bea \label{eqn:2DK_adjointdescent}
-J^{\dagger}G  &=& [D_t + \mathcal{F}diag(D_y \nabla^{-2} \omega)\mathcal{F}^{-1} D_x \continue
               &-& \mathcal{F} \nabla^{-2} D_y diag(\omega)\mathcal{F}^{-1}D_x \continue
               &-& \mathcal{F}diag(D_x \nabla^{-2}\omega)\mathcal{F}^{-1} D_y\continue
               &+& \mathcal{F} \nabla^{-2} D_x diag(\omega)\mathcal{F}^{-1}D_y \continue
               &-& \frac{\nabla^2}{Re}] \cdot G
\eea

\subsection{Kolmogorov Flow non periodic boundary conditions}

Mike Schatz and I had a conversation today via Hangouts because he wanted
to follow up on our presentation and discuss how this could possibly be relevant
to his group. The main goal we discussed was to pursue a spatiotemporal numerical
formulation for a experimentally comparable setting, namely Kolmogorov flow without
doubly periodic boundary conditions and incorporating Rayleigh
friction. I explained that the key difference would
be to change to a Chebyshev polynomial basis due to the boundary conditions but work
with the vorticity field as is common practice.

For starters, I'll describe the basic formulation for \eqva\, in a Chebyshev-Chebyshev basis. The key details is that to have accurate or
viable numerics the spatial grid would have to be defined not on an equidistant,
rectangular grid but rather defined at (this is a specific choice, but a common one)
what are known as the Chebyshev-Gauss Lobatto quadrature nodes. In other words, any
initial condition would either have to be either initialized in spectral space (very very preferable), or initialized on the discretized grid defined by the set of points in physical space,

\beq \label{eqn:CGLnodes}
(x_m,y_n) = (\cos (\frac{\pi m }{M}),\cos (\frac{\pi n }{N}) \,.
\eeq

It is this discretization that allows us to use a (Chebyshev) polynomial basis
in a collocation method, as an equally spaced grid would induce error from
the Runge phenomenon (like the Gibbs phenomenon for Fourier modes but for polynomial bases). One benefit (I believe?) is that the discretization has a higher
resolution near the walls. Another benefit of this specific choice of quadrature nodes
is that by definition they are the points at which the derivative of the Chebyshev
polynomials are zero, \ie $T'(x_m) = 0$. Other choices, such as the Chebyshev-Gauss nodes would instead provide the condition $T(x_m) = 0$.

With a two-dimensional spatial grid defined on the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto nodes,
we can use a discrete cosine transform to determine the spectral coefficients of the
Chebyshev polynomial basis \rf{CHQZ06}.

For a scalar vorticity field, $\omega(x_m,y_n)$, the corresponding Chebyshev modes
are calculated with the following formula

\beq
\Omega_{jk} = \frac{2}{M*N}\frac{1}{\bar{c}_j \bar{c}_k} \sum_{n,m} \frac{\omega_{nm}}{\bar{c}_n\bar{c}_m} \cos (\frac{\pi m j}{M})\cos (\frac{\pi n k}{N})
\eeq

and the corresponding inverse transformation given by

\beq
\omega_{nm}\Omega_{jk} = \sum_{j,k} \Omega_{jk} \cos (\frac{\pi m j}{M})\cos(\frac{\pi n k}{N}) \,.
\eeq

In this context there are no continuous translation symmetries, nor does the shit-reflect exist. The only remaining symmetry is in fact the rotational symmetry,
defined by action on the vorticity field $ R \cdot \omega (x,y) \rightarrow \omega (-x,-y)$.

Via the invariance condition,
\beq
\omega - R \cdot \omega = 0 \,,
\eeq
one can derive selection rules for the Chebyshev modes with spatial rotation symmetry. The rotation action is equivalent to the coordinate
transformation $x\rightarrow -x, y\rightarrow y$. Via the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto relation,

\bea
x_m &=& \cos(\pi m / M) \continue
-x_m &=& -\cos(\pi m / M) \continue
-x_m &=& \cos(\pi)\cos(\pi m / M) \continue
-x_m &=& \cos(\pi m / M + \pi) \continue
\cos^{-1}(x_m) &=& \pi m / M  + \pi \continue
\eea

which after substitution into the invariance condition (in terms of Chebyshev modes),

\beq
\sum_{j,k}\Omega_{jk}\cos (\frac{\pi m j}{M})\cos(\frac{\pi n k}{N})
=\sum_{j,k}\Omega_{jk}\cos (\frac{\pi m j}{M}+j\pi)\cos(\frac{\pi n k}{N} + k\pi) \,,
\eeq

in turn implies the following,

\beq
\Omega_{jk} = (-1)^{j+k}\Omega_{jk} \mbox{for all} j,k.
\eeq

Therefore the subset of modes $(\Omega_{jk} : j+k = \mbox{odd})$ are forced
to be zero by discrete symmetry.

These selection rules hold only for solutions in the rotationally invariant subspace, naturally.
