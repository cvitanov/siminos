A theory of turbulence that has done away with \emph{dynamics}?
We rest our case.

\item[2016-10-05 Predrag]
My approach is that this is written for field theorists, fluid dynamicists
etc., who do not see any reason to look at cat maps, so I am trying to be
pedagogical, motivate it as that chaotic counterpart of the harmonic
oscillator, something that field theorists fell comfortable with (they should
not, but they do).

\item[2016-11-13 Predrag]
The next thing to rethink: Green's functions for periodic lattices are in
ChaosBook sections D.3 Lattice derivatives and on, for the Hermitian
Laplacian and $s=2$. For real $s>2$ cat map, the potential is inverted
harmonic oscillator, the frequency is imaginary (Schr\"odinger in
imaginary time), eigenvectors real - should
be a straightforward generalization. Have done this already while studying
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck with Lippolis and Henninger - the eigenfunctions are
Hermite polynomials times Gaussians.

{\bf Cat maps and \catlatt s}

In the {\catlatt}, ``particles'' (\ie, a cat map at each  periodic lattice
site) are coupled by the next-neighbor coupling rules:
\[
q_{n, t+1}=p_{n\zeit}+(s-1)q_{n\zeit} - q_{n+1,t} - q_{n-1,t} - {m}^q_{n,t+1}
\]
\[
p_{n,t+1}= p_{n\zeit} + (s-2) q_{n\zeit} - q_{n+1,t} - q_{n-1,t} - {m}^p_{n,t+1}
\]
The symbols of interest can be found by:
\[
\Ssym{n\zeit} = q_{n,t+1} + q_{n,t-1} + q_{n+1,t} + q_{n-1, t} -  s \, q_{n\zeit}
\,.
\]

Gutkin and Osipov\rf{GutOsi15} write:
``In general, calculating periodic orbits of a  non-integrable  system  is a
non-trivial  task.   To  this  end  a  number  of  methods have  been
developed,'' and then,  for a mysterious reasons, they refer to
\refref{baranger88}.

\item[2016-11-07 Predrag]

The dynamical systems literature tends to focus on \emph{local} problems:
bifurcations of a single time-invariant solution (\eqv, \reqv, \po\ or
\rpo) in low\dmn\ settings (3-5 coupled ODEs, 1\dmn\ PDE).
The problem that we face is \emph{global}: organizing and relating
\emph{simultaneously} infinities of unstable \rpo s in
$\infty$\dmn\\ state spaces, orbits that are presumed to form the
skeleton of turbulence (see \refref{GibsonMovies} for a gentle
introduction) and are typically not solutions that possess the symmetries
of the problem. In this quest we found the standard equivariant
bifurcation theory literature not very helpful, as its general focus is
on bifurcations of solutions, which admit all or some of the symmetries
of the problem at hand.

Unlike the systems studied in \refref{BunSin88}, \catlatt\ cannot be

where both $x_t$ and $p_t$ belong to the unit interval.  For integer
$s=\tr{A} > 2$ the map is referred to as a cat map\rf{ArnAve}. It is a
fully chaotic Hamiltonian dynamical system, which, rewritten as a
second-order difference equation in $(\ssp_{t},\ssp_{t-1})$ takes a
particularly simple form \refeq{eq:CatMapNewt} with a unique integer
``winding number'' $\Ssym{t}$  at every time step $t$ ensuring that
$\ssp_{t+1}$ lands in the unit interval\rf{PerViv}.  While the dynamics
is linear, the nonlinearity comes through the $(\mod 1)$ operation,
encoded in $\Ssym{t}\in  \A$, where  \A\ is finite alphabet of possible
values for $\Ssym{t}$.

A generalization to the {\em spatiotemporal} cat map is now immediate.
Consider a 1\dmn\ spatial lattice, with field $\ssp_{n,t}$  (the angle of
a kicked rotor ``particle'' at instant $t$)  at site $n$. If each site
couples only to its nearest neighbors $\ssp_{n\pm1,t}$, and if we require
(1) invariance under spatial translations, (2) invariance under spatial
reflections, and (3) invariance under the space-time exchange, we arrive
at the 2\dmn\ Euclidean cat map lattice  \refeq{CatMap2d}.
Note that both equations \refeq{eq:CatMapNewt},
\refeq{CatMap2d} can be brought into uniform notation  and
generalized  to $d$ dimensions by converting the spatialtemporal
differences to discrete derivatives. This yields the Newton (or Lagrange)
equation for the $d$\dmn\ {\em \catlatt} \refeq{dDCatsT}
where $\Box$ is the discrete $d$\dmn\ Euclidean space-time Laplacian,
given by $\Box\, \ssp_t \equiv \ssp_{t+1} - 2\ssp_{t} + \ssp_{t-1}$,
$\Box \ssp_{n,t+1}\equiv \ssp_{n,t+1} + \ssp_{n,t-1} - 4 \, \ssp_{n,t} +
\ssp_{n+1,t} + \ssp_{n-1, t}$  in $d=1$ and $d=2$ dimensions,
respectively.  The key insight (an insight that applies to all
coupled-map lattices, and all PDEs modeled by them, not only the system
considered here) is that a $d$\dmn\ spatiotemporal pattern
\(
\{\ssp_{z}\} = \{\ssp_{z},  z\in \integers^{d}  \}
\)
is described by the corresponding {\em $d$\dmn} spatiotemporal
symbols {\brick}
\(
\{\m_{z}\} = \{\m_{z}, z\in \integers^{d}\}
\,,
\)
rather than a \emph{single} temporal symbol sequence (as one is tempted
to do when describing a finite coupled $N^{d-1}$-``particle'' system).

the cat map
% \refeq{eq:CatMapNewton1}
in one dimension (temporal dynamics of a single
``particle'') and for the \catlatt\ \refeq{dDCatsT} in $d$~dimensions
(temporal dynamics of a ($d$-1)\dmn\ spatial lattice of $N^{d-1}$
interacting ``particles,'' $N\to\infty$).
Linearity of \refeq{dDCatsT} enables us to solve for $\{\ssp_{z}\}$ given
$\{\Ssym{z}\}$ by lattice Green's function methods. However, dependence
on the parameter $s$ introduces an infinite set of grammar rules for
{\admissible} itineraries $\{\Ssym{z}\}$.
In this paper we focus on the $d=1$ case (introduced in \refref{PerViv}), and
the $d=2$ case (introduced in \refref{GutOsi15}).

some potential verbiage for abstract, introduction:

% predrag/lectures/DD19/abstract.txt                2018-11-16
Recent advances in fluid dynamics reveal that the recurrent patterns
observed in turbulent flows result from close passes to unstable
invariant solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. While hundreds of such
solutions been computed, they are always confined to small computational
domains, while the flows of interest (pipe, channel, plane flows), are
flows on infinite spatial domains. To describe them, we recast the
Navier-Stokes equations as a spacetime theory, with all infinite
translational directions treated on equal footing.

We illustrate this by solving what is arguably the simplest classical
field theory, the discretized {\sPe}, or the
"{\spt} cat", and describe its repertoire of {\admissible}
{\spt} patterns. We encode these by {\spt} symbol
dynamics (rather than a single temporal string of symbols).

In the {\spt} formulation of turbulence there are no periodic
orbits, as there is no time evolution. Instead, the theory is formulated
in terms of unstable spacetime tori, which are minimal tilings of
spacetime. The measure concept here is akin to the statistical mechanics
understanding of the Ising model - what is the likelihood of occurrence
of a given spacetime configuration?

\bigskip

Herding cats

In the {\spt} formulation of turbulence the zeta functions
(Fredholm determinants) are presumably 2-d or (1+3)-d
Laplace/Fourier transforms of trace formulas, one dimension for
each continuous symmetry: one Laplace transform for time, and one
Fourier transform for each infinite spatial direction.

We have not written either the trace or the determinant formulas
yet. The \catlatt\ periodic points (invariant 2-tori)
counting suggests a way, so far unexplored.

We sketch how these are
to be encoded by {\spt} symbol dynamics, in terms of
minimal exact coherent structures. To determine these, radically
different kinds of codes will have to be written, with space and
time treated on equal footing.

\begin{itemize}
  \item review cat map in damped Poisson formulation
  \item explain solution for {\templatt}
  \item show few plots of 2D solutions
  \item future: computational literature that advocates for {\spt} computations

In practice one can supply only symbol sequences of finite length, in which
case the truncated \refeq{1dLatGreenFct} returns a finite trajectory $\ssp_{t}$, with a
finite accuracy. However, a periodic orbit $p$ of period $n$ (an $n$-cycle)
is infinite in duration, but specified by a finite {\admissible} {\brick}
     \(p=[\Ssym{1}\Ssym{2}\cdots \Ssym{n}]\). %\,,\;\Ssym{t}\in\A\).
To generate all {\admissible} $n$-cycles for a given $n$, list all {\orbit}
symbol sequences
      \([\Ssym{1}\Ssym{2},\cdots \Ssym{n}]\,,\) %\;\Ssym{t}\in\A\),
(one string per its $n$ cyclic permutations, not composed from
repeats of a shorter cycle),
apply \refeq{1dLatGreenFct} with cyclic $[n\!\times\!n]$ $g_{tt'}$, and then apply
modulus one to all points in the cycle,
\beq
  \ssp_{t}=\sum_{t'=t}^{n+t-1} g_{tt'} \Ssym{t'}
       \quad \mod \, 1
\,.
\ee{cyleIgnorant}
If the cycle is {\admissible}, $\mod \, 1$ does not affect it. If it is
{\inadmissible}, add the string to the list of pruned symbol strings.
One can even start with any random sequence
      \([\Ssym{1}\Ssym{2}\cdots \Ssym{n}]\),
have $\mod \, 1$ corral back the stray $\ssp_{t}$'s into the unit interval, and
in this way map any {\inadmissible} symbol sequence into an {\admissible}
trajectory of the same duration.

where $\jMorb_n$ is the {\jacobianOrb} of the periodic orbit with period $n$. If any
${\bf \ssp}$ on the torus satisfies \refeq{HLCountingFigure}, this ${\bf

$\jMorb_n$ to stretch the torus and counting the number of integer points
enclosed in the stretched region. I plotted the stretched region of

unit square stretched by the {\jacobianOrb} $\jMorb$. There are 4 {\color{blue} blue} dots
which are the integer points in the {\fundPip}. Each one of these
{\color{blue} blue} dots corresponds to a periodic point. The 4 {\color{green}
green} dots are integer points on the vertices of the {\fundPip}. These 4
points contribute to 1 periodic point. So there are 5 periodic points with period
2, corresponding to 3 periodic solutions (1 fixed point and 2 2-cycles). The area
of this {\fundPip} is 5.

\refFig{fig:HLCountingFigures}\,(b) shows the periodic points with length 3. The
square cube with black border is the available region of torus $(\ssp_n,
\ssp_{n+1}, \ssp_{n+2})$. After stretched by {\jacobianOrb} $\jMorb$ it becomes the
{\fundPip} with red border. There are 6 {\color{blue} blue} dots which are
the integer points completely enclosed in the {\fundPip}. The 8
{\color{green} green} dots are integer points on the vertices of the
{\fundPip}, which contribute to 1 periodic points. There are 18 {
pink} points which are integer points on the surface of the {\fundPip}. These
18 points contribute to 9 periodic points. So the number of periodic points is 16

I redid the shadowing plot in a larger $[18 \times 18]$ \brick\ with
$s=5$. The algorithm is same as before:

(1) Start with a random {\admissible} state $\Xx^{0}$ with $-1/2 \leq \ssp_z
< 1/2$. Calculate the corresponding symbol \brick\ $\Mm^{0}$. The
$\Ssym{z}$s in this symbol \brick\ are not integers. So we need to round
these $\Ssym{z}$s to the nearest integers and get symbol \brick\
$\Mm^{1}$

(2) Use the Green's function and the integer symbol \brick\ $\Mm^{1}$ to
calculate the state $\Xx^{1}$. If the maximum $\ssp_{max}$ is larger or
equal to 1/2, calculate the distance $\delta \ssp_{max} = \ssp_{max} -
1/2$. Round up $s \delta \ssp_{max}$ (and call it $\delta \Ssym{max}$).
Then change the corresponding symbol $\Ssym{max}$ to $\Ssym{max} - \delta
\Ssym{max}$. If the minimum $\ssp_{min}$ is smaller than 1/2, calculate
the distance $\delta \ssp_{min} = - \ssp_{min} - 1/2$. Round up $s \delta
\ssp_{min}$ (and call it $\delta \Ssym{min}$). Then change the
corresponding symbol $\Ssym{min}$ to $\Ssym{min} + \delta \Ssym{min}$.

(3) Now we get a new symbol \brick\ $\Mm^{2}$. Repeat step (2) until all
$\ssp_z$ in $\Xx$ are in the {\admissible} range.

Using this method we get two periodic \brick s of symbols shown in
\reffig{fig:HL18Shadowing12Source}. In these two \brick s of symbols the
$\Ssym{z}$ within the $[12\times12]$ square region with black borders are
the same. The periodic field generated by these two \brick s of symbol
are shown in \reffig{fig:HL18Shadowing12Field}.

What I'm considering is: the symbols are on \twots,  so as we go further from the center of the shared region, we are getting closer to the shared region of the next tile.

In \refappe{s:GenFctn} we derive the Lagrangian formulation of cat maps.

Cat map is so simple that going from Hamiltonian to Lagrangian
formulation amounts to replacement \refeq{Ham2Lagr} of momentum
by velocity.
Still, for what follows, it might pay off to understand the general
theory of transformations from discrete Hamiltonians to discrete
Lagrangians; we review that in  refappe {s:GenFctn}.

The new results follow from our determination of \statesp\ generating partitions
generated by the iterations of the cat map, for different integer values
of the stretching parameter $s$.

, new kinds of
determinants, new relations between propagation of temporal vs. spatial
disturbances; some of these are derived in XXX eq.~{s:Green}.

Following eqs. {PerViv2.1a} and {PerViv2.1b}:
Here $2\pi \coord$ is the  angle of the rotor, $p$ is the
momentum conjugate to the angular coordinate $\coord$, the angular pulse
$P(\coord)=P(\coord+1)$ is periodic with period $1$, and the time step
has been set to $\Delta\zeit= 1$.
Eq.~\refeq{PerViv2.1b} says that in one time step $\Delta\zeit$ the
configuration trajectory starting at $\coord_{\zeit}$ reaches
$\coord_{\zeit+1} = \coord_{\zeit}+p_{\zeit+1}\Delta {\zeit}$,
and
\refeq{PerViv2.1a} says that at each kick the angular momentum
$p_{\zeit}$ is accelerated to $p_{\zeit+1}$ by the force
$P(\coord_{\zeit})\Delta\zeit$.
As the values of $\coord$ differing by integers are identified, and the
momentum $p$ is unbounded, the phase space is a cylinder. However, one
can analyze the dynamics just as well on the compactified phase space,
with the momentum wrapped around a circle, \ie, adding $\mod 1$ to
\refeq{PerViv2.1a}. Now the dynamics is a toral automorphism acting on a
$(0,1]\times(0,1]$ phase space square of unit area, with the opposite
edges identified.

We shall refer here to the least unstable of the cat maps
\refeq{catMap}, with $s=3$, as the `Arnol'd cat
map'\rf{ArnAve,deva87}, and to maps with integer $s\geq 3$ as `cat
maps'.

For {\catlatt} \refeq{CatMap2d} the field $\ssp_{n\zeit}$ takes values in
the $\speriod{}\period{}$\dmn\ unit hyper-cube
$\Xx\in[0,1)^{\speriod{}\period{}}$, where $\speriod{}$ is the `spatial',
and $\period{}$ the `temporal' lattice period.

Flows described by {\pdes} are in principle infinite dim\-ens\-ion\-al,
and, at first glance, turbulent dynamics that they exhibit might appear
hopelessly complex. However, what is actually observed in experiments and
simulations is that turbulence is dominated by repertoires of
identifiable recurrent vortices, rolls, streaks and the
like\rf{science04}. Dynamics on a low-dim\-ens\-ion\-al chaotic attractor
can be visualized as a succession of near visitations to exact unstable
periodic  solutions of the equations of motion, interspersed by transient
interludes\rf{DasBuch}. In the same spirit, the long-term turbulent
dynamics  of spatially   extended systems can  be thought of as a
sequence of visitations through the repertoire of {\admissible}  {\spt}
patterns, each framed by a finite {\spt}
window. The question we address here is: can states of a strongly
nonlinear field theory  be described by such repertoires of {\admissible}
patterns explored by turbulence?
And if yes, what is the likelihood to observe any such pattern?

Such  questions have been   studied  extensively for systems of  small
spatial extension, where the attractor dimension is relatively
small\rf{Christiansen97,SCD07,CviGib10,ACHKW11,KreEck12}.
However, going from  spatially small to spatially infinite systems
will require completely new tools.
For small systems the
long time dynamics can be thought of as motion of a point within an
inertial  manifold  of a moderate dimension.

The key property of hyperbolic flows is that nearby trajectories can
\emph{shadow} each other for finite times controlled by their stability
exponents. One common way to quantify `nearness' is to determine the
minimal Euclidean distance between pairs of trajectories. That kind of
distance is not invariant under symplectic transformations, and is thus
meaningless in the Hamiltonian phase space. Here the notion of action
comes to rescue:
\emph{the symplectic invariant distance between a pair of shadowing
orbits is given by the difference of their actions}\rf{LiTom17b}.

To prove that the product of cosines gives Chebyshev polynomial, the
simplest way is to use the identity from Grashteyn and Ryzhik\rf{GraRyz}
{\em Table of Integrals, Summations and Products}
(Academic Press, New York, 1965) 1.395.2:
\beq
\cosh nx -\cos ny
  = 2^{n-1} \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \big\{ \cosh x - \cos(y+\frac{2 k \pi}{n}) \big\}
\, .
\label{TableOfISP13952}
\eeq
Let $y=0$, $\cosh x = s/2$, and multiply both side by 2, \refeq{TableOfISP13952} becomes:
\beq
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \big\{ s - 2 \cos(\frac{2 k \pi}{n}) \big\}
=2 \{\cosh[n \, \mbox{arcosh}(s/2)] - 1\}
\, .
\label{TableOfISP13952-2}
\eeq
By the definition of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind:
\[
T_n(x) = \cosh(n \, \mbox{arcosh} \, x), \quad \mbox{if} \, x \geq 1 \, ,
\]
the right hand side of \refeq{TableOfISP13952-2} is $2\,T_{n}(s/2) -2$,
same as \refeq{POsChebyshev}.

%Using the standard theory of Toeplitz matrices (or the orthonormality of

For
a {\lattstate} $\Xx_\Mm$ with period $\cl{}$, the \jacobianOrb\
\refeq{jacobianOrb} is a $[\cl{}d\times\cl{}d]$ block matrix
\beq
\begin{array}{cc}
 \\ \\ \jMorb & = \\ \\
\end{array}
\left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\id & & & & -\jMat \\
-\jMat & \id & \\
& ~~\cdots~~ & \id \\
 & & ~~\cdots~~ & \id \\
 & & &-\jMat & \id
\end{array}
\right)
= \id-\jMat \otimes \shift^{-1}
\,,
\ee{dDmnForwardJacobianB}
where $\id$ is a $d$\dmn\ identity matrix, $\jMat$ is the one time
step $[d\times d]$ \jacobianM\ \refeq{dDmn1stepJac1}, and $\shift$ is
the $[\cl{} \times \cl{}]$ {\shiftOp} matrix with period $\cl{}$.

To evaluate the determinant of the \jacobianOrb, expand $\ln \det \jMorb = \tr \ln \jMorb$:
\bea
\ln \det \jMorb
&=& \tr \ln (\id-\jMat \otimes \shift^{-1}) \continue
&=& - \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}\tr (\jMat \otimes \shift^{-1})^k
\, .
\label{dDmnForwardJacobianLnDet}
\eea
Note that $(\jMat \otimes \shift^{-1})^k = \jMat^k \otimes \shift^{-k}$ and
$\tr (\jMat^k \otimes \shift^{-k})
= \tr (\jMat^{\cl{}r} \otimes \id_{[\cl{}\times\cl{}]}) \delta_{k,\cl{}r}
= \cl{} \tr (\jMat^{\cl{}r}) \delta_{k,\cl{}r}
$
 which is not 0 only when $k$ is a multiple of $\cl{}$.
\bea
\ln \det \jMorb
&=& - \sum_{r=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cl{} \tr (\jMat^{r\cl{}})}{r\cl{}}
 =  \tr [- \sum_{r=1}^{\infty} \frac{(\jMat^{\cl{}})^r}{r}] \continue
&=& \tr \ln (\id - \jMat^{\cl{}})
 =  \ln \det (\id - \jMat^{\cl{}})
\, .
\label{dDmnForwardJacobianLnDet2}
\eea
So the determinant of the \jacobianOrb\ is $\det \jMorb = \det (\id - \jMat^{\cl{}})$.


hence
\beq
\det \jMorb_\Mm

    \det(\jMat_\Mm-\id)

To diagonalize this rank-4 {\jacobianOrb} we need to use the the eigenvectors \refeq{2DEigenvector} to form a rank-4 tensor:
\[
U_{i_1,j_1,i_2,j_2}=
\exp\left(
      i\frac{2 \pi}{6}(2 i_2 i_1 - i_2 j_1 + 3 j_2 j_1)
        \right) \, .
\]
The inverse of this tensor is the conjugate transpose $U^\dagger$:
\[
(U^\dagger)_{i_1,j_1,i_2,j_2} = (U_{i_2,j_2,i_1,j_1})^* \, .
\]
The diagonalized {\jacobianOrb} is:
\[
(\jMorb_{\mathrm{diagonalized}})_{i_1,j_1,i_2,j_2}
= \sum_{i_3=0}^2 \sum_{j_3=0}^1 \sum_{i_4=0}^2 \sum_{j_4=0}^1 (U^\dagger)_{i_1,j_1,i_3,j_3} \jMorb_{i_3,j_3,i_4,j_4} U_{i_4,j_4,i_2,j_2} \, .
\]
The diagonalized {\jacobianOrb}'s element $(\jMorb_{\mathrm{diagonalized}})_{i_1,j_1,i_2,j_2}$ is not 0 only when $i_1 = i_2$ and $j_1 = j_2$. We can get the inverse of this diagonalized tensor, $\jMorb_{\mathrm{diagonalized}}^{-1}$, by changing the non-zero elements to their inverse. Then inverse of the {\jacobianOrb} is:
\[
(\jMorb^{-1})_{i_1,j_1,i_2,j_2} =
\sum_{i_3=0}^2 \sum_{j_3=0}^1 \sum_{i_4=0}^2 \sum_{j_4=0}^1 U_{i_1,j_1,i_3,j_3} (\jMorb_{\mathrm{diagonalized}}^{-1})_{i_3,j_3,i_4,j_4} (U^\dagger)_{i_4,j_4,i_2,j_2} \, .

The elements of the inverse {\jacobianOrb} are:
\[
(\jMorb^{-1}_{0,0})_{i_2, j_2} = \frac{1}{35}

 \begin{array}{ccc}

Your difficulty is that you keep on thinking in Hamiltonian way, where
one steps in time, using the Hamilton's equations for $(q_t,p_t)$, where
we had replaced the momentum $p_t$ (at spatial position $\ell$) by
velocity $p_t=(\ssp_{\ell t}-\ssp_{\ell,t-1})/\Delta t$, and thus
initializing the Hamiltonian, a second-order difference equation for
\emph{evolution in time} by two horizontal rows $(\ssp_{\ell
t},\ssp_{\ell,t-1})\,,\;\ell\in\integers$ in the spacetime plane.

You have to think in the spacetime, Lagrangian way instead. On each
lattice site $z=(\ell,t)$ there is a scalar field $\ssp_{\ell t}$, not a
two-torus. The field $\ssp_{\ell,t-1}$ belongs to a neighboring site
$z=(\ell,t-1)$. The two fields do not form a dynamical system on a
two-torus, as the dynamics is also influenced by spatial neighbors
$\ssp_{\ell\pm1, t}$.

\ee{dDBravaisLattice}

The {\jacobianOrb} \refeq{catlattFix} is constructed from $d$ commuting
translation operators $\shift_{i}$ with $i=1, \dots, d$. The eigenvectors of these translation
operators are plane waves:
 \beq
f_{k}({z}) = e^{i {k} \cdot {z}}

satisfy the periodicity \refeq{dDPeriodicCondition}, unless
\beq
e^{i {k} \cdot {R}} = 1
\, .
\ee{PeriodicPlaneWave}
Since ${R}$ is a vector from the Bravais lattice $\lattice$, the wave
vector $\mathbf{k}$ must lie in the reciprocal lattice of $\Lambda$:
\beq

\Lambda^* =
\left\{ \sum_{i=1}^d m_i \mathbf{b}_i\,|\,m_i \in \mathbb{Z}\right\} \, ,

 \beq

\ee{ReciprLattBasis}
To get the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues
of the \jacobianOrb, note that
\beq
(\shift_j + \shift_{j}^{-1}) e^{i {k} \cdot {z}}
=
e^{i ({k} \cdot {z} - k_j)} + e^{i ({k} \cdot {z} + k_j)}

(2 \cos k_j) e^{i {k} \cdot {z}} \, ,
\ee{EigenvalueTranslation}

{\jacobianOrb} \refeq{catlattFix} corresponding to the eigenvector with
the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ \refeq{PlaneWave} is
\beq
\lambda_{k} = \sum_{j=1}^d \left( 2\cos k_j - s \right)

and compute
its inverse, the Green's function.

The generalization to $d$ \spt\ dimensions is immediate.
A periodic {{\lattstate}} ${\Xx}=\{\ssp_z\}$, $z\in\integers^d$ is
a {point} within the $(\ell_1\ell_2\cdots\ell_d)$\dmn\
unit hyper-cube $[0,1)^{\ell_1\ell_2\cdots\ell_d}$, where $\ell_j$
is the lattice period in direction $j$, and the
$(\ell_1\ell_2\cdots\ell_d)^2$\dmn\ {\jacobianOrb} $\jMorb_{zz'}$ is
given by
\beq
\jMorb = \sum_{j=1}^{d}\left(\shift_j-{s}\id+\shift_{j}^{-1}\right)
\,.
\ee{catlattFixover}
Here $\shift_i$ is a {\shiftOp}
\refeq{hopMatrix} which translates the field in the $i$th
direction by one lattice spacing. Its inverse $\shift_{i}^{-1}$
translates the field in the negative $i$th direction.


From now on we specialize to the 2\dmn, $z=(n,\zeit)\in\integers^2$
\spt\ lattice, and replace the $(\ell_1,\ell_2)$ notation for lattice
periods by $(\speriod{},\period{})$, where $\speriod{}$ is the `spatial',
and $\period{}$ the `temporal' lattice period. The field $\ssp_i$
takes values in the $\speriod{}\period{}$\dmn\ unit hyper-cube
$\Xx\in[0,1)^{\speriod{}\period{}}$.

Throw away all {\brick}s which are repeats of
shorter {\brick}s in the temporal direction. What
remains in $N_k$ prime periodic \brick s $p$ of the same size
$[\speriod{p}\times\period{p}]=[\speriod{k}\times\period{k}]$.

This is essential to all that follows, as the Lagrangian formulation will
apply to \catlatt\ in any number of spatial dimensions as well.

             stability of an orbit vs. its time-evolution stability}

{\bf 2020-07-14 Han}

To prove the Hill's formula \refeq{detDetCat} for the cat map, first note
that both the left hand side and right hand side are polynomials with the
same leading terms $s^\cl{}$. The left hand side is the determinant of
the tri-diagonal Toeplitz matrix \refeq{Hessian}.  From the
\refeq{StabMtlpr} and \refeq{noPerPts}, the right hand side can be
written in the form  %\label{Isola90-13}
\bea
|\det(\jMat^{\cl{}} - \id)|
          &=& \ExpaEig^{\cl{}} + \ExpaEig^{-\cl{}} - 2 \continue
          &=& 2 \cosh( \cl{} \Lyap) -2 \continue
          &=& 2 \cosh \left[ \cl{} \textrm{arc}\cosh\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\right] -2
          \,,
\label{HillsForR}
\eea
where we used $s=2\cosh(\Lyap)$. As the Chebyshev polynomial of
the first kind can be written as $T_\cl{}(x) = \cosh [ \cl{}
\textrm{arc}\cosh(x)]$, the right hand side of \refeq{detDetCat} is
\[
|\det(\jMat^{\cl{}} - \id)|
=
2 T_\cl{}\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)-2 \, ,
\]
which has the leading term $s^\cl{}$.

Let $u = (u_j)_{j = 1, 2, \dots, \cl{}}$ be the variation to the periodic
orbit $\Xx$ with length $\cl{}$. $\jMorb u = 0$ only if $\jMat^\cl{} w =
w$ where $w=(u_1,u_2)$. Then $|\det(\jMat^{\cl{}} - \id)|=0$ is
equivalent to $|\Det\jMorb|=0$. Then the polynomials $|\Det\jMorb|$
and $|\det(\jMat^{\cl{}} - \id)|$ have the same roots and the same
leading terms so they are equal.

{\bf 2020-07-17 Han}

Let $s$ go to infinity. Then the stability multipliers becomes:
\bea
\lim_{s \to \infty} \ExpaEig = \lim_{s \to \infty} \frac{s+\sqrt{s^2-4}}{2} = s \, , \continue
\lim_{s \to \infty} \ExpaEig^{-1} = \lim_{s \to \infty} \frac{2}{s+\sqrt{s^2-4}} = \lim_{s \to \infty} \frac{1}{s} =0 \, .
\label{StabMtlprLimit}
\eea
Then in the limit:
\beq
\lim_{s \to \infty} |\det(\jMat^{\cl{}} - \id)|
          = \lim_{s \to \infty} \ExpaEig^{\cl{}} + \ExpaEig^{-\cl{}} - 2
          = s^\cl{}
          \,,
\ee{HillsForRightLimit}
So the leading term of the right hand side of \refeq{detDetCat} is $s^\cl{}$.

\bea
|\det(\jMat^{\cl{}} - \id)|
          &=& \ExpaEig^{\cl{}} + \ExpaEig^{-\cl{}} - 2 \continue
          &=& \left(\frac{s+\sqrt{s^2-4}}{2}\right)^\cl{} + \left(\frac{s-\sqrt{s^2-4}}{2}\right)^\cl{} -2 \continue
          &=& \frac{1}{2^\cl{}} \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{\cl{}}{2}} {2k \choose \cl{}} s^{\cl{}-2k}(s^2-4)^k - 2
          \,,

Alternatively, one can consider the dynamics on the

and its \po\ theory\rf{art91,CGS92}, with unit circle \po s in one-to-one

Turbulence everywhere in space, with a range of length scales.

We start the paper with a reformulation of the 1 degree of freedom
Bernoulli map, because our goal, the \catlatt\ is nothing but its
generalization to a mechanical system in spacetimes of arbitrary
dimension, and thus arguably the simplest possible example of a `chaotic
field theory'.

first reading.

The reader who already knows everything can start

$F[\Xx]=0$ is uniquely encoded by a finite alphabet $d$\dmn\ symbol
{\lattstate}  $\Mm$

Remarkably, as far as the linear symbolic dynamics  is  concerned, the
above results hold both for the single cat map and its coupled lattice
generalization.
In both cases the  proofs rely only upon ellipticity of the operator
$\Box$ and the linearity of the equations. It is very plausible  that the
same results hold for the lattices $\integers^d$  of an arbitrary
dimension $d$.

Furthermore, the restriction to the integer valued
matrices in the definitions of maps appears unnecessary. Cat map is a
smooth version of the sawtooth map, defined by the same equation
\refeq{OneCat}, but for a real (not necessarily integer) value of $s$.
The linear symbolic dynamics  for single saw map has been analyzed in
\rf{PerViv} and its extension  to a coupled $\integers^d$ model along the
lines of the present paper seems to be straightforward.

Also,  in the
current paper we sticked to  the Laplacian  form of $\Box$.   Again this
seems to be too restrictive and extension to other elliptic  operators of
higher order should be possible. Such operators are necessarily appear
within the models with higher range of interactions.

A physically necessary extension of  current setting would be addition of an
external periodic potential ${V}$ to \refeq{dDCatsT}, rendering this a
nonlinear problem,
 \begin{equation}
 (\Box - s+ 2d+ {V}'(\ssp_z)) \ssp_z = \Ssym{z}, \qquad z\in \integers^{d}
 \,. \label{LinearConnPerturbed}
\end{equation}
As long as the perturbation ${V}$ is sufficiently weak, this lattice map can
be conjugated to the linear {\catlatt}, with ${V}=0$.
This approach has been used in \refref{GutOsi15} to construct partner
{\twots} for perturbed cat map lattices.
On the other hand, for a sufficiently strong perturbation, such a conjugation
to linear system is no longer possible. Finally, let us note that the lattice
models like  \refeq{LinearConnPerturbed} can be seen  as discretized versions
of PDEs.
In this respect it would be of  interest  to study whether our results  can
be extended to the continuous, PDE setting.

In particular,  the following
questions  seem to be  of fundamental importance:

 \begin{itemize}
\item
 Can  an effective $d=2$ symbolic dynamics with finite alphabet  be
 constructed for an example of a PDE with {\spt} chaos, such
 that
 (a)  Connection between periodic field  solutions and their
 symbolic representation is unique;
 (b) The local  symbolic content would
 define  the values of the corresponding fields with the exponentially
 decreasing errors?
