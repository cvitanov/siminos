\section{Reciprocal lattice}
\label{sect:LC21recip1d} % started with {sect:RhombCornerFT}

Think of a solution of a discrete time dynamical system as a 1\dmn\
temporal {\lattstate} with the field on each site labeled by integer
time.
A period-$\cl{}$ {\lattstate} lives on a discrete 1-torus (a ring or chain or
necklace) of period-$\cl{}$, and if its law is time-invariant, its orbit, the set of
{\lattstate}s related to it by cyclic translations, are
physically equivalent. The symmetry is the cyclic group
\Cn{n}, and one only needs to count and distinguish \Cn{n} \emph{{\orbit}s},
compute only one {\lattstate} per each orbit.

The smart way to do this is by going to the irreducible representations
of \Cn{n} by discrete Fourier transform.
Were the lattice $d$\dmn, defined by Bravais cell vectors $\{\mathbf{a}\}$, a
crystallographer would immediately move to the \emph{reciprocal}
lattice,
\( %beq
\tilde{\lattice}_{\mathbf{b}} = \{k \mathbf{b}\,|\, k \in \mathbb{Z}\}
\,,
\) %ee{LC21:Rcpr1dLatt}
with {reciprocal}
lattice basis vectors $\{\mathbf{b}\}$ satisfing
\( %beq
\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 2 \pi
\,.
\) %ee{LC21:Rcpr1dVect}
On the {reciprocal} lattice translations are
quotiented out, and calculations are restricted to a finite
{Brilluoin zone} (this is the {`Bloch theorem'} of
solid state physics). Here we work on a 1\dmn\ lattice with unit
lattice spacing 1, so the reciprocal lattice spacing is $2\pi/1=2\pi$, with
the (first) Brillouin zone from $k=-\pi$ to $k=\pi$.


The group elements of the \Cn{n} permutation representation
are generated by
the $[\cl{}\!\times\!\cl{}]$ shift matrix
\refeq{hopMatrix} which
 translates for\-ward-in-time a {\lattstate} \refeq{1dLattStatC_n} by one site,
$\transp{(\shift \Xx)}=(\ssp_1,\ssp_2,\cdots,\ssp_{\cl{}-1},\ssp_0)$.
After $\cl{}$ shifts, the {\lattstate} returns to the initial
state, yielding the characteristic equation for the matrix $\shift$
\beq
\shift^\cl{}-\id=0
\,,
\ee{shift2n}
whose eigenvalues are $\cl{}$th roots of unity, with the $\cl{}$ complex
eigenvectors also built from roots of unity
\bea
\{\lambda_k\} &=& \{1, \omega, \omega^2,\cdots, \omega^{\cl{}-1}\}
                \,,\qquad\qquad\quad
                  \omega=\e^{2\pi\mathrm{i}/\cl{}}
                \continue
\tilde{e}_k   &=&
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{\cl{}}}
    (1, \omega^k, \omega^{2k}, \ldots, \omega^{k(\cl{}-1)})
    \,,\qquad k=0, 1,\ldots, \cl{}-1
\,.
\label{FourierModes}
\eea
In the $\{\tilde{e}_k\}$ discrete Fourier basis, a real $\cl{}$\dmn\
{\lattstate} vector $\Xx$ is mapped onto a $\cl{}$\dmn\ complex
{reciprocal} lattice  vector
\beq
\tilde{\Xx} = (\cssp_{0},\cssp_{1},\cssp_{2},\dots,\cssp_{\cl{}-1})
\,.
\eeq
The $k$th Fourier mode has magnitude $|\cssp_k|$ and phase $e^{i\theta_k}$.

On the reciprocal lattice, the dynamics is breathtakingly simple: no
matter what the dynamical system is, all reciprocal {\lattstate}s
literally run in circles.
The shift matrix is diagonal, $\shift_{jk}=\omega^k\,\delta_{jk}$,
and when the shift operator acts on the {\lattstate}, $\Xx \to \shift \Xx$,
the $k$th Fourier mode magnitude $|\cssp_k|$ remains the same, while
its phase is incremented by an $\cl{}$th fraction of the circle:
\bea
(\ssp_0,\ssp_1,\ssp_2,\cdots,\ssp_{\cl{}-1}) &\to&
    (\ssp_1,\ssp_2,\cdots,\ssp_{\cl{}-1},\ssp_0)
\continue
e^{\mathrm{i}\theta_k} &\to& \omega^k e^{i\theta_k}
                      = e^{\mathrm{i}(\theta_k+2\pi{k}/\cl{})}
\,.
\eea
In other words, for non-zero $k$ and $|\cssp_k|$, all reciprocal
{\lattstate}s lie in complex plane on vertices of regular $\cl{}$-gons,
inscribed in circles of radius $|\cssp_k|$, one for each orbit.

\HL{2021-12-28}{
This is not correct. In the $k=1$ and $k=\cl{}-1$ subspaces, all
reciprocal {\lattstate}s lie in complex plane on vertices of regular
$\cl{}$-gons. Generally this is not true. See
\reffigs{fig:HLCatMapLength6C2C3}{fig:HLCatMapLength6C6} $k=2$ and $k=3$
(in blogCat), where the shift $\shift$ rotate the reciprocal {\lattstate}
by $2 \pi/3$ and $2 \pi/2$, instead of $2\pi/6$. I suggest we only
mention $k=1$ here.
}
\PC{2021-12-30}{
It does not say in The Bible that vertices of an $n$-gon have to be visited
in increments of one. {\Lattstate}s lie on the vertices of $n$-gons for
any $k$, they are just visited in different order for different $k$. An
if $n$ is not prime, some visitation sequences do not visit all vertices.
That's OK. Every vertex is occupied.
}

As a concrete example, consider first the 7 period-3 {\lattstate}s of
the temporal Bernoulli \refeq{1stepDiffEq} for stretching parameter $s=2$.
It is a linear problem and all {\lattstate}s are easily computed
by hand, one for each $\Mm$. There is always the 3rd repeat of the
fixed point {\lattstate} $(0,0,0)$, and the remining 6 {\lattstate}s
belong to 2 period-3 orbits, which we mark by a single {\lattstate}
per orbit, for example
$(\frac{1}{7},\frac{2}{7},\frac{4}{7})$
and
$(\frac{3}{7},\frac{6}{7},\frac{5}{7})$.
Discrete Fourier transform maps
these 7 {\lattstate}s into 7 reciprocal {\lattstate}s of \reffig{fig:BernC3}.

Consider next the action of the shift operator $\shift$ on the reciprocal
{\lattstate}s. The $k=0$ component of any reciprocal {\lattstate} is
invariant under the shift. In the $k=1$ and $k=2$ subspaces, the shift
$\shift$ acts by complex phase rotations $\exp(2 \pi \mathrm{i}/3)$ and
$\exp(4 \pi \mathrm{i}/3)$, respectively: reciprocal {\lattstate}s that
belong to the same orbit lie on a circle in the complex plane, and are
related by complex rotations. \refFig{fig:BernC3} illustrates
this; the two period-3 orbits, built from reciprocal {\lattstate}s that
are related by shifts, are connected by blue lines.

\subsection{Fundamental domain} % of the {\lattstate}}

Given the symmetry group of the {\lattstate}s,
we can find a fundamental domain in the space of field configurations
such that each orbit in this space visits the fundamental domain only once.
Each {\lattstate} in the fundamental domain is a representative {\lattstate} of an
orbit.

A natural way to choose the fundamental domain of \Cn{\cl{}} symmetry group
is to divide the subspace of a component of the reciprocal lattice configuration.
In the subspace of the $k=1$ Fourier mode, the fundamental domain is an $1/\cl{}$
wedge. The lattice shift $\shift$ maps the fundamental domain by rotation and
tiles the whole complex plane. Orbits visit the $1/\cl{}$
wedge only once, so the points in the fundamental domain represent an orbit each.
Repeats of the shorter {\lattstate}s sit on the 0 of the complex plane, which is on
the boundary of the fundamental domain.

For example, one can choose the region in the complex plane of $\cssp_1$ with
argument $-\pi/2\cl{}\leq\theta_1<\pi/2\cl{}$ to be the fundamental domain.
Each orbit can visit the fundamental domain only once. For the period-3 {\lattstate}s
of the {temporal Bernoulli system} with $s=2$ shown in \reffig{fig:BernC3},
there are 3 points in this region, which are representative {\lattstate}s of two different
period-3 orbits and the fixed point $0$.

As a next example, consider the 121 period-5 reciprocal {\lattstate}s
of the $s=3$ \templatt\ \refeq{catMapNewt} plotted in \reffig{fig:templattC5}.
The number of {\lattstate}s in the fundamental domain is 25. One of
them is the constant $(0,0,0,0,0)$ state. Each one of the other, prime orbit
solutions contributes 5 times to $N_5$, the total number of {\lattstate}s
belong to the same time orbit. So we have the total number of solutions:
$N_5=121=1+M_5\times5 = 1+24\times5$, see \reftab{tab:lattstateCountCat}.
