% was {{\Henlatt}}
\label{s:henlatt}

The `mod~1' in the definition of the `linear' kicked rotor, the cat map
\refeq{catMap}, makes cat map a highly nonlinear, discontinuous map. In
contrast, field theory action $\action[\Xx]$ is typically polynomial and
smooth. The simplest such nonlinear action turns out to correspond to the
paradigmatic dynamicist's model of a 2\dmn\ nonlinear dynamical system,
the {\HenonMap}\rf{henon}
\bea
    x_{\zeit+1} &=& 1-a\,x_{\zeit}^2 + b\,y_{\zeit}
        \continue
    y_{\zeit+1} &=& x_{\zeit}
\,.
\label{LC21eq2.1}
\eea
For the contraction parameter value $b=-1$ this is a Hamiltonian map.

The \emph{temporal evolution} \jacobianM\ for the $n$th iterate of the
Hamiltonian {\HenonMap} is the product of consecutive  one time-step
\jacobianMs
\beq
\jMps^\cl{}(x_0,y_0) =
\prod_{m=\cl{}-1}^{0}
            \left(\begin{array}{cc}
                -2a\,x_m & -1 \\
                         1 & 0
            \end{array}\right)
\,,\qquad x_m = \map^{m}_1 (x_0,y_0)
\,,
\ee{Henlatt-e_her}
where the successive 1-time step \jacobianMs\ are multiplied in the order
they are applied, as
$\jMps^\cl{}(x_0)=\jMps(x_{\cl{}-1})\cdots\jMps(x_0)$. So, once we have a
{\HenonMap} {\po}, we also have its Floquet
(monodromy) matrix. When $\jMps^\cl{}$ is
hyperbolic, only the expanding
eigen\-value $\ExpaEig_1=1/\ExpaEig_2$ needs to be determined, as the
determinant of the {\Henon} 1-time step \jacobianM\ is unity,
\beq
\det\jMps = \ExpaEig_1 \ExpaEig_2 = 1
\,.
\ee{LC21:HenDet}
The map is Hamiltonian in the sense that it preserves areas in the
$[x,y]$ plane.


The {\HenonMap} is the simplest map that captures chaos that arises from
the smooth stretch \& fold dynamics of nonlinear {\PoincMap}s of flows
such as R\"ossler\rf{ross}.
Written as a  2nd-order inhomogeneous difference equation\rf{DulMei00},
\refeq{LC21eq2.1} takes the
{\em \henlatt} 3-term recurrence form, explicitly time-translation
and time-reversal invariant Eulerâ€“Lagrange equation
% \refeq{LC21:1dHenlatt}:
\beq
-\ssp_{\zeit+1} + {a}\,\ssp_{\zeit}^2 - \ssp_{\zeit-1} = 1
\,.
\ee{LC21:2-step}
Just as the kicked rotor (\ref{LC21PerViv2.1b},\ref{LC21PerViv2.1a}), the map can
be interpreted as a kicked driven anaharmonic oscillator\rf{Heagy92},
with the nonlinear, cubic Biham-Wenzel\rf{afind} lattice site potential
\refeq{polynPotent}
\beq
V(\ssp_\zeit,\Ssym{\zeit}) =  \frac{a}{3}\ssp_{\zeit}^3
                            - \ssp_{\zeit}^2 -\Ssym{\zeit}\,\ssp_\zeit
    \,,\qquad
        \Ssym{\zeit} = -1
\,,
\ee{LC21BWcubic}
giving rise to kicking pulse \refeq{LC21PerViv2.1a}, so we
refer to this field theory as $\ssp^3$ theory.

Thus the lattice site field values of this $\phi^3$ theory are in
one-to-one correspondence to the unimodal \HenonMap\
Smale horseshoe repeller, cleanly split into the `left', positive stretching and
`right', negative stretching lattice site field values.
Devaney, Nitecki, Sterling and Meiss\rf{Devaney79,StMeiss98,SteDuMei99}
have shown that the Hamiltonian {\HenonMap} has a complete Smale
horseshoe for sufficiently large `stretching parameter' values
\beq
      a > 5.699310786700\cdots
\;.
\ee{LC21:SterlHen}
In numerical\rf{ChaosBook} and analytic\rf{EndGal06} calculations we fix
(arbitrarily) the stretching parameter value to $a=6$, in order to
guarantee that all $2^\cl{}$ periodic points  $\ssp=\flow{\cl{}}{\ssp}$
of the {\HenonMap} \refeq{LC21eq2.1} exist, see \reftab{tab:LC21HamHenon}.
The symbolic dynamics is as simple as the temporal Bernoulli, in contrast to the
\templatt\ which has nontrivial pruning, see \reftab{tab:lattstateCountCat}.


\section{A {$\phi^4$} field theory}
\label{s:phi4latt}

If a potential that is bounded from below is needed to make sense of the
probabilistic interpretation of the configuration weight
\refeq{ProbConf}, or a symmetry forbids the odd-power potentials such as
\refeq{LC21BWcubic}, one starts instead with a quartic potential
\refeq{polynPotent}
\beq
V(\ssp_\zeit,\Ssym{\zeit}) =  \frac{g}{4}\ssp_{\zeit}^4
                            - \ssp_{\zeit}^2 -\Ssym{\zeit}\,\ssp_\zeit
\,,
\ee{LC21phi4pot}
leading to an example of the `{$\phi^4$} lattice field theory'.
\refeq{LC21:1dPhi4},
\bea
- \ssp_{\zeit+1} + {g}\,\ssp_{\zeit}^3 - \ssp_{\zeit-1}
    &=&
\Ssym{\zeit}
\,.
\label{LC21:1dPhi4a}
\eea
Topology of the \statesp\ of $\phi^4$ theory is
very much like
what we had learned for the unimodal \HenonMap\ $\phi^3$ theory,
except that the repeller set is now bimodal. As long as coupling $g$
is sufficiently large, the repeller is a full 3-letter shift.
Indeed, while Smale's first horseshoe\rf{smale}, his fig.~1, was unimodal, he
also sketched the $\phi^4$ bimodal repeller, his fig.~5.

As $\phi^4$ example adds little to understanding
over what is learned from \henlatt, we will not discus is further in this
paper.


\subsection{Computing {\lattstate}s for nonlinear theories}
\label{s:nonlinLattStates}

Unlike the {temporal Bernoulli} \refeq{LC21:1dBernLatt} and the
{\templatt} \refeq{LC21:1dTemplatt}, for which the {\lattstate} fixed
point condition \refeq{LC21eqMotion}
% {tempCatFixPoint}
is linear and easily solved, for
nonlinear lattice field theories the {\lattstate}s are roots of
polynomials of arbitrarily high order. While Gallas and collaborators%
\rf{EndGal01,EndGal02,EG05,EG05a,EndGal06,Gallas18,Gallas20,Gallas20a}
have developed a powerful theory that yields {\HenonMap} {\po}s in
analytic form, it would be unrealistic to demand such explicit solutions for
general field theories on multi-dimensional lattices. We take a
pragmatic, numerical route, and search for the fixed-point solutions
\refeq{LC21eqMotion}
starting with the deviation of an approximate trajectory from the 3-term
recurrence \refeq{LC21:1dTempFT}, given by the lattice deviation vector
\beq
v_{\zeit} = -\ssp_{\zeit+1} + V'(\ssp_{\zeit},\Ssym{\zeit}) - \ssp_{\zeit-1}
\,,
\ee{LC21BWdeviate}
and minimizing this error term by any convenient variational or
optimization method, perhaps in conjunction with a high-dimensional
variant of the Newton method\rf{CvitLanCrete02,lanVar1}.

\subsection{Remarks}

Equilibria or steady solutions of
the $d$-dimensional Frenkel-Kontorova Hamiltonian lattice differential
equation\rf{AuAb90,MraRin12}
\beq
\frac{d^2 \ssp_i}{dt^2} + V'[\ssp_i] - \Box\,\ssp_i
    = 0 \ \mbox{for all} \ i\in\mathbb{Z}^d.
\ee{LC21FKHam}
are examples of what we here call `nonlinear field theories'.
The model describes the motion of particles under the
competing influence of an onsite periodic potential field and nearest
neighbor attraction.

{\em Anti-integrability in dynamical and variational problems}

The \eqva\ and \reqva\ of Frenkel-Kontorova models\rf{AuAb90,MraRin12}, widely studied in
literature, might be closely related to \henlatt\ and $\phi^4$ lattices.

Univ. of Colorado,
{\em Anti-Integrable Continuation and the Destruction of Chaos} has much
to teach us. He studies \emph{coupled {\HenonMap} lattices} in both
Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations; his definition seems pretty much
consistent with our \refeq{SVWhenSTlatt}, though he has a coupling
parameter $c$ used to make spatial couplings weak. The
``anti-integrable'' refers to our choice $a\geq6$, I believe - parameter
regimes in which all of the horseshoe orbits exists.

``Specifying the anti-integrable state for an orbit of a coupled map
lattice requires a multidimensional symbolic object which we call a
symbol tensor.''

His Figures 6.7, 6.18 are reminiscent of my pruning front.

Politi and Torcini\rf{PolTor92} note that
a problem in reconstructing the statistical properties of an
{\spt\ H{\'e}non} attractor
is ensuring that all \twots\  used are embedded into the inertial manifold.
For instance, in the single H{\'e}non map, one
of the two fixed points is isolated and it does not belong to the strange
attractor.

We resolve this problem by construction, all our solutions belong to the
non-wondering set.

%\item[2020-05-31 Predrag]
Politi and Torcini\rf{PolTor92} {\em Periodic
orbits in coupled {H{\'e}non} maps: {Lyapunov} and multifractal analysis}

They study \emph{\spt\ \Henon}, a (1+1)-spacetime lattice of
\Henon\ maps orbits which are periodic both in space and time.

Their numerical method is an extension of Biham and Wenzel\rf{afind} for
the single \Henon\ map, with symbols $\Ssym{n\zeit}$ in $\A=\{0,1\}$. Any
fixed point in fictitious time corresponds to a spatio-temporal cycle
$\BravCell{\speriod{}}{\period{}}{\tilt{}}$.


We are lucky that strong coupling, strong local stretching field theories
deterministic solutions live on horseshoes. That keeps safely away from the
regions of intermediate stretches, where dragons live.
