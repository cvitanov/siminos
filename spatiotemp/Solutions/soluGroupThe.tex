The molecule on the left has $C_i$ symmetry which is inversion symmetry
NOT reflection symmetry because the top and bottom arrangements are not
like they would be if placed in front of a mirror. The molecule on the
right has $C_{3v}$ symmetry, which is pyramidal symmetry which
corresponds to the fact that one could take three slices of the molecule
and they would each be identical, not just the configuration would be
preserved by a rotation.

Apparently, it depends based on whether we are dealing with staggered
Ethane or not. If it is staggered, then it has inversion symmetry, if it
is not, it has reflection symmetry, it should have $C_{3}$ symmetry
instead of $C_{3v}$ which confuses me a great deal. If I remember
correctly it should correspond to a reflection vertical plane, which it
should have, so I do not understand. The third one is $C_2$ which I do
not understand how it is different from the inversion symmetry. Although,
looking at simulations from
\HREF{https://www.chemtube3d.com/sym-ethanestaggered/}{here}, it looks
like the $C_2$ group can be used to rotate about axes that are different
in orientation from just right through the middle.
