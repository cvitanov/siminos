  In this case, there are $(n+6)/2$ classes:
  $\{e\}$,
  $\{\shift_{n/2}\}$,
  $\{\shift_{k},\shift_{n-k}\}$,
  $\{\Refl,\Refl\shift_{2},\cdots,\Refl\shift_{n-2}\}$ and
  $\{\Refl\shift_{1},\Refl\shift_{3},\cdots,\Refl\shift_{n-1}\}$.
  There are four different one\dmn\ irreducible representations,
  whose characters are $\pm 1$ under reflection $\Refl$ and translate-reflect
  operation $\Refl\shift_{1}$. We get \reftab{tab:DnEven}.
