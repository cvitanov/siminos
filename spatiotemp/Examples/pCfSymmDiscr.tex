The \pCf\ is a fluid flow bounded by two countermoving planes, in a cell
periodic in streamwise and spanwise directions. The Navier-Stokes
equations for the \pCf\  have two discrete symmetries: reflection through
the (streamwise , wall-normal) plane, and rotation by $\pi$ in the
(streamwise , wall-normal) plane. That is why the system has \eqv\ and \po\
solutions, as well as \reqv\ and \rpo\ solutions discussed in
\refchap{c-continuous}). They belong to discrete symmetry subspaces.
