  A 3\dmn\ matrix representation of the 3-element cyclic group
  $\Cn{3}=\{e,\shift,\shift^2\}$ is given by the three rotations by
  $2\pi/3$ around the $z$-axis in a 3\dmn\ \statesp,
  \bea
  {D}(e) &=&
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & & \\
    & 1 & \\
    & & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \,,\quad
  {D}(\shift) =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos\frac{2\pi}{3}  & -\sin\frac{2\pi}{3} & \\
    \sin\frac{2\pi}{3}  & ~\cos\frac{2\pi}{3}  & \\
    & & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \,,

  {D}(\shift^2) &=&
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos\frac{4\pi}{3}  & -\sin\frac{4\pi}{3}  & \\
    \sin\frac{4\pi}{3}  & ~\cos\frac{4\pi}{3}  & \\
