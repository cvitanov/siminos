(Continued from \refexam{exam:C3cosets})\\
The three classes of the 3-disk symmetry group
$\Dn{3} =\{ e, \shift, \shift_2,\Refl,\Refl_{1},\Refl_{2}\}$,
are the identity, any one of the reflections, and the two rotations,
 \beq
 \{ e \}\,,\quad
    \left\{\barr{c}
   \Refl     \\
   \Refl_{1} \\
   \Refl_{2}
    \earr\right\}
     \,,\quad
   \left\{\barr{c}
    \shift   \\
    \shift_2
    \earr\right\}
\,.
 \label{3diskClasses}
 \eeq
In other words, the group actions either flip or rotate.
