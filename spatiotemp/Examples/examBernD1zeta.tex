\example{\Dn{1}-symmetry factorization of the temporal Bernoulli
         zeta function.}{\label{exam:BernD1zeta}
       \PC{2021-08-03}{
Making up the Bernoulli \Dn{1}-symmetry example, will need it for \textbf{LC21}.
        }
For the particularly simple, linear {Bernoulli} case at hand,
the field $\ssp_\zeit$ is a scalar,
the 1-time step $[1\!\times\!1]$ time-evolution \jacobianM\
\refeq{d-1stepJac2} at every lattice point $\zeit$ is simply
$\jMat_{\zeit}={s}$,
and
the {\jacobianOrb}
\refeq{tempBern} is the same for all, in general
distinct {\lattstate}s of period $\cl{}$,
so
\beq
N_\cl{} = |\Det\jMorb| = {s}^{\cl{}} - 1
\,;
\ee{detBern2}
% in agreement with the time-evolution count \refeq{noPerPtsBm};
all
itineraries are allowed, except that the periodicity of
$\shift^\cl{}=\id$ accounts for $\cycle{0}$ and
$\cycle{s\!-\!1}$ fixed points (see \reffig{fig:BernPart}) being a
single periodic point.

For a Bernoulli system \refeq{detBern2},
\bea
\zetatop(z)
 &=&  \exp \left(-\sum_{\cl{}=1}^\infty
\frac{z^\cl{}}{\cl{}} ({s}^\cl{} - 1)
         \right)
\,=\,
\exp \left[\ln(1 -  {s}z) - \ln(1 - z) \right]
\continue
 &=&
\frac{1 -  {s}z}{1 - z}
\,.
\label{BernZeta}
\eea
The numerator $(1 - {s}z)$ says that a Bernoulli system is a full
shift\rf{CBcount}: there are $s$ fundamental {\lattstate}s, in this case
fixed points $\{\ssp_0,\ssp_1,\cdots,\ssp_{s-1}\}$, and every other
{\lattstate} is built from their concatenations and repeats. The
denominator $(1 - z)$ compensates for the single overcounted {\lattstate}, the fixed point $\ssp_{{s}-1}=\ssp_{0}$ $(\mbox{mod}\;1)$ of
\reffig{fig:BernPart} and its repeats.

The dynamical $\Dn{1}$-symmetry factorized zeta function,
analogous to \refeq{AABHM99-46},
follows from \refeq{symm-isin}:
\bea
\frac{1}{\zeta(z)}
    &=&     \frac{1}{\zeta_{A_1}(t)}\,\frac{1}{\zeta_{A_1}(-t)}
    \,,\qquad
    z=t^2\,,\; {s} = \mu^2
\continue
\frac{1}{\zeta_{A_1}(t)}
    &=&  \frac{1-{\mu}t}{1 - t}
 \,.
\label{BernZetaFact}
\eea
The antisymmetric $A_2$ subspace \dzeta\ $\zeta_{A_2}$ differs from
$\zeta_{A_1}$ only by a minus sign for cycles with an odd number of
$1$'s, see \refeq{zetaA2}. At the level of the linear Bernoulli map, this
seems a triviality, but for a nonlinear \refexam{exam:Symm1d}, it
is not; all cycles are computed numerically in the
$\Dn{1}$-symmetry-reduced fundamental domain \reffig{Symm1d:BernBentFund}.
