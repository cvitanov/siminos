The {\HenonMap} \refeq{Ham-eq2.1.0} is reversible, with its inverse
interchanging the roles of $x$ and $y$:
\index{Henon@H\'enon map!reversible}
\index{map!reversible!H\'enon}
\index{reversible!H\'enon map}
\index{reversor}\index{involution}
\bea
    x_{n-1}&=& y_n
                \continue
    y_{n-1}&=& a-y^2_n - x_n
\, ,
\label{Ham-eq2.1.1}
\eea
hence the dynamics is symmetric in the  $[x,y]$ plane: a trajectory maps into a
trajectory under the flip across the $x=y$ diagonal
\beq
       \VectorII{y}{x} = R\VectorII{x}{y}
         =\MatrixII{0}{1}{1}{0} \VectorII{x}{y}
\ee{HenRev}
{\em and} the time reversal.
The reversor $R$ is {\orev}, $\det[\partial R]=-1$, and is an involution,
$R^2=\id$.
In other words, the Hamiltonian {\HenonMap} is conjugate to its inverse $f\circ
R=R\circ f^{-1}$, and can be factored into a pair of {\orev} involutions,
$f=(fR)\circ R=T\circ R$, with
\beq
       T\VectorII{x}{y} = \VectorII{x}{a-{x}^{2}-y}
\;.
\ee{HenRev2}
% Any image of a reversor is also a reversor.
% the full
% set $\{ (f^jR, f^jS) , j \in \integers\}$
% form an infinite set of reversors.
Equivalently, writing $f = S \circ (Sf) = S \circ U$, the reversor
\beq
       U\VectorII{x}{y} = \VectorII{a - y^2 - x}{y}
\ee{HenRev3}
factorizes the {\HenonMap} as $f = ST$.
