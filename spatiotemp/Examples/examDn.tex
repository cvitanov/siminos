The dihedral group
$\Dn{n} \subset \On{2}$, $n =1,2,3,\cdots$
(sometimes called \Cnv{n}),
can be generated by two elements one at least of which must
orientation reversing.
For example, take $\Refl$ corresponding to reflection across the
$x$-axis. $\Refl^2 = e$; such operation is called an
{\em involution}.
\index{involution}
$\shift{}$ to rotation through $2\pi/n$,
then $\Dn{n} = \langle \Refl,\shift \rangle$, and the defining relations are
$\Refl^2 = \shift^{n} = e$, $(\shift\Refl )^2 = e $.
