A second-order difference equation with constant coefficients has the form
\beq
\ssp_{\zeit+2} + p_1\ssp_{\zeit+2} + p_2\ssp_{\zeit} = 0
%\,.
\ee{Elaydi99(4.21)}
Let $\ssp_{0,\zeit}=\ssp_{\zeit}$, $\ssp_{1,\zeit}=\ssp_{\zeit+1}$,
and rewrite this as a pair of coupled first-order difference equations
\bea
\Xx_{\zeit+1} &=& A\,\Xx_{\zeit}
    \,,\qquad
\Xx_{\zeit} = \transp{(\ssp_{0,\zeit}, \ssp_{1,\zeit})}
    \continue
A &=&  \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0    & 1 \cr
-p_2 & -p_1
\end{array}
\right)
\,.
\label{Elaydi99(4.22)}
\eea
The characteristic equation
\beq
\lambda^{2} + p_1\lambda + p_2 = 0
%\,.
\ee{Elaydi99(4.23)}
can be obtained by substitution $\ssp_{\zeit}=\lambda^{n}$ into the
two-term recursion \refeq{Elaydi99(4.21)}.

If $\lambda_1\neq\lambda_2$, $\lambda_j$ real, then the solution of
\refeq{Elaydi99(4.21)} is
\beq
\ssp_{\zeit} = c_1\lambda_1^\zeit + c_2\lambda_2^\zeit
\,.
\ee{Elaydi99(4.24)}
If $\lambda_1=\lambda_2=\lambda$, then the  solution is
\beq
\ssp_{\zeit} = c_1\lambda^\zeit + c_2\zeit\lambda^\zeit
\,.
\ee{Elaydi99(4.25)}
If $\lambda_1=\alpha +i\beta$, $\lambda_2=\alpha -i\beta$, then the solution
is
\beq
\ssp_{\zeit} = |\lambda|^\zeit(c_1\cos\zeit\omega + c_2\sin\zeit\omega)
\,,
\ee{Elaydi99(4.26)}
where $\omega= \arctan(\beta/\alpha)$.
To solve such second-order difference equation, one has to specify
initial conditions, for example
\(
\ssp_{0}=1, \ssp_{1}=0
\,.

\subsection{Third-order difference equation}

\subsubsection{Third-order difference equation.}

\label{exam:diffEq4term}

One can always reformulate an $k$-term recursion relation
\refeq{Elaydi05(2.3.1)} as a set of
$k$ coupled first-order difference equations (delay equations).
For example, one can rewrite the three-term recursion relation (third-order
difference equation)
\beq
\ssp_{\zeit+3} + p_1\ssp_{\zeit+2} + p_2\ssp_{\zeit+1} + p_3\ssp_{\zeit} = 0
%\,.
\ee{Elaydi05(5.2.4)}
as three coupled first-order difference
equations
\bea
\ssp_{0,\zeit+1} &=& \ssp_{1,\zeit},
    \continue
\ssp_{1,\zeit+1} &=& \ssp_{2,\zeit},
    \continue
\ssp_{2,\zeit+1} &=& -p_3\ssp_{0,\zeit} -p_2\ssp_{1,\zeit}- p_1\ssp_{2,\zeit}
\,.
\label{Elaydi05(5.2.4a)}
\eea
where $\ssp_{0,\zeit}=\ssp_{\zeit}$, $\ssp_{1,\zeit}=\ssp_{\zeit+1}$,
$\ssp_{2,\zeit}=\ssp_{\zeit+2}$. Compactly
\bea
\Xx_{\zeit+1} &=& A\,\Xx_{\zeit}
    \,,\qquad
\Xx_{\zeit} = \transp{(\ssp_{0,\zeit}, \ssp_{1,\zeit}, \ssp_{2,\zeit})}
    \continue
A &=&  \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & 0 \cr
0 & 0 & 1 \cr
-p_3 & -p_2 & -p_1
\end{array}
\right)
\,.
\label{Elaydi05(5.2.4b)}
\eea
The eigenvalues of $A$ are the characteristic roots of
\refeq{Elaydi05(5.2.4)}, see  \refeq{Elaydi05(2.3.2)} and
\refeq{FGHLW74:charFunct1d}.

The discrete time derivative of a {\lattstate} \Xx\ evaluated at the
lattice site \zeit\ is given by the \emph{difference operator}
    \index{lattice!derivative}\index{derivative, lattice}
    \index{lattice!derivative, forward}\index{difference operator}
\beq
\dot{\Xx}_\zeit =
\left[\frac{\partial\Xx}{\partial\zeit}\right]_\zeit
        =
    \frac{\ssp_{\zeit} - \ssp_{\zeit-1}}{\Delta\zeit}
\ee{lattTimeDer1}
Eq. \refeq{Elaydi05(5.2.4b)} can be viewed
as a time-discretized, first-order ODE dynamical system
\beq
   \dot{\Xx} \,=\, \vel(\Xx)
\,,
\ee{1stepVecEq}
with the time increment set to $\Delta\zeit=1$
