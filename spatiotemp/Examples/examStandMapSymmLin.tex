    %\RA{Drop or modify and move to periodic orbit search as section/exercise/remark}
In practice the search for important classes of periodic orbits for the
standard map takes advantage of its remarkable symmetry: $A$ can be
written as the product of two {\em involutions},
$A = T_2 \cdot T_1$,
% $T_1$ and $T_2$
(involution means that the square of the map is the identity):
    \toRem{rem:symmLines}
\bea
% A &=& T_2 \cdot T_1
%        \continue
T_1 (x\,,\,y) &=&  (-x \,,\, y-k\sin x)
        \continue
T_2 (x\,,\,y) &=& (-x+y \,,\, y)
\, .
\label{StandMapInvol}
\eea
Now define symmetry lines ${\cal L}_1$ and ${\cal L}_2$ as the sets of fixed
points of the corresponding involution: ${\cal L}_1$ consists of the lines
$x=0, \pi$, ${\cal L}_2$ of $x=y/2 \,\,mod \, (2 \pi)$. There are deep
connections between symmetry lines and periodic orbits: we just give an
example with the following statement: if $(x_0,y_0) \in {\cal L}_1$ and
$A^M(x_0,y_0)\in {\cal L}_1$ ({\em i.e.} they are both fixed points of $T_1$),
then $(x_0,y_0)$ is a periodic point of period $2M$.
\PC{2021-04-03}{Bad notation - $M$ is \monodromyM}
As a matter of fact
\bea
A^{2M}(x_0,y_0)\,&=&\,A^{M-1}T_2T_1A^{M-1}T_2T_1(x_0,y_0) \nonumber \\
{\, \,} &=&\, A^{M-1}T_2A^{M-1}T_2(x_0,y_0)
\eea
by the fixed point property. Now the involution property implies
\beq
T_2A=T_1 \qquad \,\, AT_1=T_2
\eeq
and thus
\beq
AT_2AT_2\,=\,A T_1T_2\,=\,\matId
\eeq
and
\beq
A^PT_2A^PT_2\,=\,A^{P-1}T_2A^{P-1}T_2
\eeq
from which it easily follows that $(x_0,y_0)$ belongs to a $2M$ cycle.
