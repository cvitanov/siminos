  The  \Dn{n} group
  \[
    \Dn{n}=\{e,\shift,\shift^2,\cdots,\shift^{n-1},\Refl,\shift\Refl,\cdots,
    \shift^{n-1}\Refl\}
  \]
  has
  $n$ rotation elements and $n$ reflections.
  Group elements satisfies $\shift^i\cdot \shift^j\Refl=\shift^j\Refl\cdot \shift^{n-i}$,
  so $\shift^i$ and $\shift^{n-i}$ form a class. Also,
  $\shift^{n-i}\cdot \shift^{2i+j}\Refl=\shift^j\Refl\cdot \shift^{n-i}$ implies that
  $\shift^j\Refl$ and $\shift^{2i+j}\Refl$ are in the same class. Therefore,
  there are only three different types of classes:
  $\{e\}$, $\{\shift^k,\shift^{n-k}\}$ and
  $\{\Refl,\shift\Refl,\cdots, \shift^{n-1}\Refl\}$. The total number of
  classes is $(n+3)/2$. In this case, there are 2 one\dmn\
  irreducible representations (symmetric $A_1$ and antisymmetric $A_2$ )
  and $(n-1)/2$ two\dmn\ irreducible representations. In the $j$th
  two\dmn\ irreducible representation, class $\{e\}$ has form
  $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
    1&0\\ 0&1
  \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$,
  class $\{\shift^k,\shift^{n-k}\}$ has form
  $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
    \exp(\frac{i2\pi kj}{n}) &0 \\ 0& \exp(-\frac{i2\pi kj}{n})
  \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$,
  and class $\{\Refl,\shift\Refl,\cdots, \shift^{n-1}\Refl\}$ has form
  $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
    0&1\\ 1&0
  \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$.
  We get \reftab{tab:DnOdd}.
