The Lozi map
\[
    x_{n+1}=1- \sign{n} ax_{n} +bx_{n-1} \, .
\]
written as a 3-term recurrence relation
\beq
    x_{n+1}-2x_{n}+x_{n-1}+(2+\sign{n} a)x_{n} -(b+1)x_{n-1}=1
\, .
\ee{Lozi2-step}
That has the same nonlinear term $\sign{n} x_{n}$ as \refeq{TentLinCode},
so maybe we can figure out the pruning front as well, in this
formulation.
