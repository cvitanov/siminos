\example{\tempLatt\ shadowing.}{\label{exam:CatShad}
% was \section{s:tempCatShadow} in CL18 cat.tex

As the
relation between the symbol {\brick}s $\Mm$  and the corresponding
{\lattstate}s $\Xx_\Mm$ is linear, for $\Mm$ an {\admissible} symbol
\brick, the corresponding {\lattstate} $\Xx_\Mm$ is given by
the Green's function
\beq
\Xx_\Mm
= \gd\,\Mm
\,,\qquad
\gd = \frac{1}{-\shift + s\id - \shift^{-1}}
\,,
\ee{tempCatGreen}
as in the Bernoulli case \refeq{tempBernGreen}.

As in \refsect{s:bernShadow}, the Green's function \refeq{tempCatGreen}
decays exponentially  with the distance from the origin, a fact that is
essential in establishing the `shadowing' between {\lattstate}s sharing
a common sub-\brick\ \Mm. For an infinite temporal lattice
$\zeit\in\integers$, the lattice field at site $\zeit$ is determined by
the sources $\Ssym{\zeit'}$ at all sites ${\zeit'}$, by the  Green's function
$g_{\zeit\zeit'}$ for one\dmn\ discretized heat
equation\rf{PerViv,varcyc},
\beq
  \ssp_{\zeit}=\sum_{\zeit'=-\infty}^\infty g_{\zeit\zeit'} \Ssym{\zeit'}
\,, \qquad
%  g_{\zeit\zeit'} =
%       \left(\frac{1}{-\Box -2 +s}\right)_{\zeit\zeit'}
g_{\zeit\zeit'}=\frac{1}{\ExpaEig-\ExpaEig^{-1}}\,
                \frac{1}{\ExpaEig^{|\zeit-\zeit'|}}
% \,,\qquad
% s=\ExpaEig+\ExpaEig^{-1}
\,,
\ee{1dLatGreenFct}  %{Coord}
with $\ExpaEig$ is the expanding stability
multiplier defined in \refeq{StabMtlpr}.

Suppose there is a non-vanishing point source $\Ssym{0}\neq0$ only at the
present, $\zeit'=0$ temporal lattice site. Its contribution to
$\ssp_{\zeit}$ $\sim \ExpaEig^{-|\zeit|}$ decays exponentially  with the
distance from the origin. More generally, as in the Bernoulli case
\refeq{Bern_cyc}, if two {\lattstate}s $\Xx$, $\Xx'$ share a common
sub-\brick\ \Mm\ of length \cl{}, they shadow each other with accuracy of
order of $O(1/\ExpaEig^{\cl{}})$.
