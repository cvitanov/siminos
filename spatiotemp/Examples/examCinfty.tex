Consider the integer lattice $\integers$. The \emph{infinite cyclic
group} $\Cn{\infty}$ is generated by  $\shift$, the right shift by one
lattice spacing
%(note - no inverse $r^{-1}$, so not really a group)
\beq
\Cn{\infty} = \left\langle \shift \mid
            \shift^\ell, \ell\in\integers
              \right\rangle
\,.
\ee{Cinfty}
Every finite index subgroup of the {infinite cyclic group} $\Cn{\infty}$
is also {cyclic}, isomorphic to $\Cn{\cl{}}$
\beq
H(\cl{}) = \langle  \shift^\cl{} \rangle \, ,
\ee{ArtMaz1}
with index
\beq
|\Cn{\infty}/H(\cl{})| =  |\cl{}|
\,.
\ee{ArtMaz3}


The \emph{infinite cyclic group} elements
are all shifts
\bea
\Cn{\infty}
  &=&
              \left\langle
      \shift_j
              \mid
      \shift_j= \shift^{j};\;
      j\in\integers
              \right\rangle
  \continue
  &=&
            \{
\cdots, \shift_{-2}, \shift_{-1},
        1,
        \shift_{1}, \shift_{2}, \shift_{3}, \cdots
             \}
\,,
\label{examC_infty}
\eea
where $\shift_{j}=\shift^j$ denotes translation by $j$ lattice sites.
$\shift_{0}=1$ denotes the identity.
Cyclic group multiplication adds translations.
