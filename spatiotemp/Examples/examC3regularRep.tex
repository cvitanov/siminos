 (continued from \refexam{exam:C3matrRep})~~
  Take an arbitrary function $\rho(\ssp)$ over the \statesp\ $\ssp \in \pS$, and
  define a fundamental domain $\pSRed$ as a 1/3 wedge, with axis $z$ as its
  (symmetry invariant) edge. The \statesp\ is tiled with three copies of the wedge,
  \[
    \pS =  \pSRed_1\cup\pSRed_2\cup\pSRed_3
    =  \pSRed\cup \shift\pSRed\cup \shift^2\pSRed
    \,.
  \]
  Function $\rho(\ssp)$ can be written as the 3\dmn\ vector of functions
  over the fundamental domain $\sspRed \in \pSRed$,
  \beq
  (\rho_1^{reg}(\sspRed),\rho_2^{reg}(\sspRed),\rho_3^{reg}(\sspRed))
  = (\rho(\sspRed),\rho(\shift\sspRed),\rho(\shift^2\sspRed))
  \,.
  \ee{eq:C3RegRep}
  The multiplication table of $\Cn{3}$ is given in \reftab{tab:C3MultTab}.
  By \refeq{eq:RegRep}, the regular representation matrices
  $D^{reg}(\LieEl)$ have `1' at the location of $\LieEl^{-1}$ in the
  multiplication table, `0' elsewhere. The actions of the operator
  $U(\LieEl)$ are now represented by permutations matrices (blank entries
  are zeros):
  \beq
  D^{reg}(e) = %&=&
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & & \\
    & 1 & \\
    & & 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix} \,,  \quad
  % \continue
  D^{reg}(\shift) = %&=&
  \begin{bmatrix}
    ~ & 1 & ~\\
    ~ & ~ & 1\\
    1 & ~ & ~ \\
  \end{bmatrix}\,,  \quad
  D^{reg}(\shift^2) =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    ~ & ~ & 1\\
    1 & ~ & ~\\
    ~ & 1 & ~ \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \,.
