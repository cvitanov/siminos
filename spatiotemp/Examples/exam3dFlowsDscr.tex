\Refl\ is a {\em reflection} (or an inversion) through  the
$[x,y]$ plane.
 $\shift$ is $[x,y]$-plane, constant $z$
{\em rotation} by $\pi$ about the $z$-axis
(or an inversion thorough the $z$-axis).
$P=\shift\Refl$ is an {\em inversion} (or parity operation)
through the point $(0,0,0)$.
Singly, each operation generates a group of order 2:
$ \Dn{1} = \{e , \Refl \}$,
$ \Cn{2}  = \{e,\shift\}$,
and
$\Dn{1} = \{e , P \}$.
Together, they form the dihedral group
$ \Dn{2} = \{e , \Refl, \shift, \Refl\shift\}$
of order 4.
