\example{Temporal Bernoulli shadowing.}{\label{exam:BernShad}
% Was \section{s:bernShadow} in CL18 Bernoulli.tex

As the {temporal Bernoulli} condition \refeq{tempBern} is a linear
relation, a given \brick\ $\Mm$, or `code' in terms of alphabet
\refeq{base-sAlph}, corresponds to a unique temporal {\lattstate} $\Xx$
given by the temporal lattice Green's function
\beq
\Xx_\Mm
= \gd\,\Mm
\,,\qquad
\gd = \frac{\shift/{s}}{\id- {\shift}/{s}}
\,.
\ee{examTempBernGreen}
For an infinite lattice $\zeit\in\integers$, this Green's function can be
expanded as a series in $\ExpaEig^{-k}$,
\beq
\gd
    = \frac{\,{\shift}/{\ExpaEig}}{\id-{\shift/}{\ExpaEig}}
    = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\shift^k}{\ExpaEig^{k}}
\,,
\ee{BernGreenF}
where $\ExpaEig={s}$ is the 1-time step stability multiplier for the
Bernoulli system. From \refeq{examTempBernGreen} it follows that
the influence of a source $\Ssym{\zeit'}$ back in the
past, at site $\zeit'$, falls off exponentially with the temporal lattice
distance $\zeit-\zeit'$,
\beq
  \ssp_{\zeit}=\sum_{\zeit'=-\infty}^{\zeit-1} g_{\zeit\zeit'} \Ssym{\zeit'}
\,, \quad
g_{\zeit\zeit'}
   =
   \frac{1}{\ExpaEig^{\zeit-\zeit'}}
\,,\quad \zeit>\zeit'\,,\quad  0\mbox{ otherwise}
\,.
\ee{BernGreenSites}
That means that an ergodic {\lattstate} segment of length \cl{}\ (or a
periodic {{\lattstate}} of a longer period) is shadowed by the periodic
{{\lattstate}} \refeq{pathBern} with the same \cl{}-sites {symbol
\brick} $\Mm$,
    \PC{2020-02-16}{
Do I need to derive this?
    }
\beq
\ssp_{\zeit}
=  \frac{1}{1-1/\ExpaEig^{\cl{}}}
\left(\frac{\Ssym{1}}{\ExpaEig}+\frac{\Ssym{2}}{\ExpaEig^{2}}
      +\cdots
      +\frac{\Ssym{\cl{}-1}}{\ExpaEig^{\cl{}-1}}+\frac{\Ssym{\cl{}}}{\ExpaEig^{\cl{}}}
\right)
,
\label{Bern_cyc}
\eeq
with exponentially
decreasing shadowing error of order $O(1/\ExpaEig^{\cl{}+1})$. The error
is controlled by the \refeq{detDet} prefactor
\(
1/|\Det\jMorb| = 1/|\det(\id - \jMat_\Mm)|\,,
\)
with the determinant arising from inverting the {\jacobianOrb}
$\jMorb$ to obtain the Green's function \refeq{tempBern}.

This error estimate is deeper than what it might seem at the first
glance. In fluid dynamics, pattern recognition, neuroscience and other
high or $\infty$-dimensional settings distances between `close solutions'
(let's say pixel images of two faces in a face recognition code) are
almost always measured using some arbitrary yardstick, let's say a
Euclidean $L_2$ norm,
even though the state space that has no Euclidean symmetry.
Not so in the \po\ theory: here $1/|\Det\jMorb|$ is the \emph{intrinsic,
coordinatization and norm independent} measure of the distance between
similar \spt\ states.
