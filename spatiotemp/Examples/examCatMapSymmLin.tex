\example{Symmetry lines of the cat map.}{ \label{exam:CatMapSymmLin}
~~~(Continued from \refexam{exam:StandMapSymmLin}.)
Instead of standard map, consider its linear relative, the
cat map, obtained by substituting $k\sin x \to Kx$ in \refeq{StandMapInvol}.
$A$ can now be
written as the matrix product of two {involutions},
$A = T_2\,T_1$,
\bea
% A &=& T_2 \cdot T_1
%        \continue
T_1 (x\,,\,p) =  (-x \,,\, p-K x)
&\Rightarrow& T_1 =
         \MatrixII{-1 }{0}
				  {s-2}{1}
        \continue
T_2 (x\,,\,p) = (-x+p \,,\, p)
&\Rightarrow& T_2 =
         \MatrixII{-1}{1}
				  { 0}{1}
        \continue
&\Rightarrow& A =
         \MatrixII{s-1}{1}
				  {s-2}{1}
\,.
\label{CatMapInvol}
\eea
$T_1$ and $T_2$ are
involutions as their squares are the identity.
We have substituted $K=-s+2$, where ${s}=\tr{A}$.

\PC{2021-04-10}{complete the rewrite here.}
Now define symmetry lines ${\cal L}_1$ and ${\cal L}_2$ as the sets of fixed
points of the corresponding involution: ${\cal L}_1$ consists of the lines
$x=0   \mod 1$, ${\cal L}_2$ of $p=2x$. There are deep
connections between symmetry lines and periodic orbits: we just give an
example with the following statement: if $(x_0,p_0) \in {\cal L}_1$ and
$A^M(x_0,p_0)\in {\cal L}_1$ ({\em i.e.} they are both fixed points of $T_1$),
then $(x_0,p_0)$ is a periodic point of period $2M$.
As a matter of fact
\bea
A^{2M}(x_0,p_0)\,&=&\,A^{M-1}T_2T_1A^{M-1}T_2T_1(x_0,p_0) \nonumber \\
{\, \,} &=&\, A^{M-1}T_2A^{M-1}T_2(x_0,p_0)
\eea
by the fixed point property. Now the involution property implies
\beq
T_2A=T_1 \qquad \,\, AT_1=T_2
\eeq
and thus
\beq
AT_2AT_2\,=\,A T_1T_2\,=\,\matId
\eeq
and
\beq
A^PT_2A^PT_2\,=\,A^{P-1}T_2A^{P-1}T_2
\eeq
from which it easily follows that $(x_0,p_0)$ belongs to a $2M$ cycle.

I see no $\jMorb=\transp{\tilde{\jMorb}}\tilde{\jMorb}$ factorization in
style of \refeq{tildejMorb}  % copy of PC(1.2.11)}
