\example{Character table of cyclic group \Cn{n}.}{\label{exam:CnChars}

                                                                     \toCB
  The symmetry under a discrete rotation by angle $2\pi/n$ gives birth to a
  cyclic group $\Cn{n}=\{e,\shift,\shift^2,\cdots,\shift^{n-1}\}$.
  Since $\Cn{n}$ is Abelian, each element forms a separate class, and thus
  $\Cn{n}$ has $n$ one\dmn\ irreducible representations. The
  characters multiply as group elements:
  \(\chi_\alpha (\shift^i)\chi_\alpha
  (\shift^j)=\chi_{\alpha} (\shift^{i+j})
  \, \mod n
  \,.
  \)
  Therefore, we get \reftab{tab:CnChars}.
