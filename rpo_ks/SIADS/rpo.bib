                 most fundamental and longest-standing problems in fluid
                 dynamics. Stability theory suggests that the flow
                 remains laminar for all flow rates, but in practice
                 pipe flow becomes turbulent even at moderate speeds.
                 This transition drastically affects the transport
                 efficiency of mass, momentum, and heat. On the basis of
                 the recent discovery of unstable traveling waves in
                 computational studies of the Navier-Stokes equations
                 and ideas from dynamical systems theory, a model for
                 the transition process has been suggested. We report
                 experimental observation of these traveling waves in
                 pipe flow, confirming the proposed transition scenario
                 and suggesting that the dynamics associated with these
