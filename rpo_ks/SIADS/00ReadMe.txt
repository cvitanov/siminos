Dear Prof. Siminos,
   How are you proceeding with your revision of "State space
geometry of a spatio-temporally chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
flow," in response to the Reviewing Editor's decision letter

NOTES
-----

John F. Gibson:

Georgia Tech does subscribe to SIADS. Searching 'applied
dynamical systems' on the ejournals page brings it up under
"Electronic version: EBSCOhost Academic Search Complete."

I reviewed SIADS and Nonlinearity submission guidelines. The
key difference is that multimedia can be an essential component
of SIADS papers, whereas it must be supplementary for
Nonlinearity. SIADS is online-only and is ok with color, and
Nonlinearity has a print version and wants all figures to be
readable in black-and-white.
