Subject: periodic orbits in the full KSE and more...

As you suggested, we looked at the smaller L for the full system and found 
that L = 22.0 appears to be the smallest L with persistent chaos.  So, 
this is the system we settled to investigate, using 15 modes (30-dim 
system of ODEs).

Soon after starting the investigation, we realised that UPOs are only a 
(relatively small) part of the story for the full KSE.  Because of the 
periodic boundary conditions, the full KSE has a continuous symmetry: if 
u(x,t) is a solution, then so is u(x+d,t) for any 0 < d <= L.  As a 
result, the KS has not only the UPOs but also orbits with a shift: u(x,0) 
= u(x+d,T), where T is the period.  

We recently found out that such orbits (people call them 'relative') have 
been investigated in the complex GL equation (V. Lopez, et al., SIAM J. 
Appl. Dyn. Syst., vol. 4, pp 1042-1075).

We are currently working on the modification of our algorithm so it's able 
to detect these RPOs.  I'm attaching the figures with 30 orbits we have 
found so far.  Only three of them appear to be truly periodic.  The orbit 
with T = 95.25 has a very small d (d = -6.5e-7), but it's not periodic (we 
checked this by decreasing the integration step size and increasing the 
number of modes).

It would be interesting to see if the periodic orbit theory can be 
extended to include the RPOs for systems such as full KSE or CGLE.

Dear Dr. Davidchack,

I am a graduate student of Dr. Cvitanovic and work on KSE.  I was very 
happy to read your email since I have tried to find RPOs in the full space 
with L=38.5, with no luck.  To cross-check my code I tried to find your 
RPOs in L=22.0 and it seems that good initial guesses are easier to come 
by. The orbits located so far are those of period T=46.50 and shift 
d=-7.76, T= 65.61 and d=0.09 (which I consider as an RPO of half the 
period and d=-10.96) and the UPO with T=20.51. Yet, we (me and Dr. 
Cvitanovic) haven't thought of any systematic way to locate such orbits 
and have no intuition about what solutions to expect. If you think there 
is something else I should cross-check, please let me know.
