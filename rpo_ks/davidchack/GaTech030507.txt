Title: Looking for order within chaos: Locating and understanding 
       coherent structures within Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation

Abstract:
   In this talk I will discuss our efforts to understand the properties of 
chaotic solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by locating and 
analyzing coherent structures (equilibria, traveling waves, periodic and 
relative periodic orbits) embedded within the chaotic dynamics.  Our 
approach for locating the coherent structures is based on transforming the 
original equation in such a way that the unstable structures are 
stabilized by the transformation.  The approach has proved very successful 
in low dimensional chaotic systems and has now been extended to high 
dimensional flows such as discretized PDEs.  Using this approach we have 
found many coherent structures within a moderately chaotic regime of the 
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky dynamics and are now attempting to understand the 
chaotic dynamics in terms of these structures.
