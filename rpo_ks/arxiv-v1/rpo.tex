                \begin{abstract}
The continuous and discrete symmetries of the \KS\ system
restricted to a spatially periodic domain play a prominent
role in shaping the invariant sets of its
spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics.
The continuous spatial
translation symmetry leads to
\reqva\ (traveling wave) and \rpo\ solutions.
The discrete symmetries lead to existence of
{\eqv} and \po\ solutions,
induce decomposition
of \statesp\ into orthogonal invariant subspaces, and
enforce certain
structurally stable heteroclinic connections between \eqva.
We show, on example of a particular small-cell \KS\ system,
how the geometry of its dynamical \statesp\ is organized by a rigid
`cage' built by heteroclinic connections between \eqva, 
and demonstrate the preponderance of unstable \rpo s and their likely
role as the skeleton underpinning spatiotemporal turbulence in systems
with continuous symmetries.
We also offer novel visualizations of the high-dimensional
\KS\ \statesp\ flow
through projections onto low-dimensional,
PDE representation independent,
dynamically invariant intrinsic coordinate frames,
as well as in terms of the physical, symmetry invariant
energy transfer rates.
