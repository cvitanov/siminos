Here are PACS we have:

95.10.Fh 	Chaotic dynamics (see also 05.45.-a Nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear dynamical systems)

02.70.Bf 	Finite-difference methods

47.52.+j        Chaos (see also 05.45.-a Nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear dynamical systems; 83.60.Wc Flow instabilities)

05.45.-a(+a???)   Nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear dynamical systems (see also section 45 Classical mechanics of discrete systems)
(there is no +a in PACS2003) 


AMS classification can be found at http://www.ams.org/msc/  

Here are the entries I found that appear relevant, but there could be more, since AMS is quite detailed:

35-xx Partial differential equations
    35Bxx Qualitative properties of solutions
        35B05 General behavior of solutions of PDE (comparison theorems; oscillation, zeros and growth of solutions; mean value theorems)
        35B10 Periodic solutions
        35B15 Almost periodic solutions

    35Qxx Equations of mathematical physics and other areas of application 
        35Q35 Other equations arising in fluid mechanics

37-xx Dynamical systems and ergodic theory
    37Lxx Infinite-dimensional dissipative dynamical systems
        37L05 General theory, nonlinear semigroups, evolution equations
        37L20 Symmetries

65-xx Numerical analysis
    65Hxx Nonlinear algebraic or transcendental equations
        65H10 Systems of equations 
        65H20 Global methods, including homotopy approaches

76-xx Fluid mechanics
    76Fxx Turbulence
        76F20 Dynamical systems approach to turbulence

90-xx Operations research, mathematical programming
    90Cxx Mathematical programming
        90C53 Methods of quasi-Newton type


Proposed AMS subject classification: 35B05, 35B10, 35B15(?), 37L05, 37L20, 76F20(?), 65H10, 65H20(?), 90C53(?)

Vaggelis comments:
35B15 almost periodic is different than relative periodic so I think we shouldn't use this one.
76F20 Dynamical systems approach to turbulence fits if we consider KSe an 1D approach to turbulence and anyway it will be interesting to people searching this pac number.
65H20 Global method would be periodic orbit theory?
90C53 seems relevant as long as we keep a discussion about how to find the rpo's in the text.
