A stroll in 1D spatiotemporal chaos

Kuramoto Sivashinsky partial differential equation (KSe) is studied as one
of the simplest systems that exhibit spatiotemporally chaotic behavior
and resembles higher-dimensional fluid turbulence. Our proposed approach
is to use dynamical system tools: study the asymptotic
(large-time) dynamics by means of the invariant objects (equilibria
and periodic orbits) that organize the strange attractor. In the KSe case
the existence of continuous symmetries gives rise to dynamics on the torus
and thus the invariant objects of interest now also include relative
equilibria and relative periodic orbits.

The outline of the proposed research is as follows: We will express the
dynamics of the system in a symmetry invariant form in order to be able to
identify recurrences and produce a meaningful Poincar\'e return map of the
dynamics. This will allow us to determine the symbolic dynamics of the
system and locate invariant objects (periodic and relative periodic orbits)
in a systematic and exhaustive manner. This set of orbits completely
determines the topology of the strange attractor. Moreover it contains
information about the natural measure that will be used by means of cycle
expansions to calculate asymptotic averages for the system in question,
for example mean energy dissipation rate.
