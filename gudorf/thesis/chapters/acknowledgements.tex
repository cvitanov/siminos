I would like to sincerely thank my advisor Prof. Predrag Cvitanovi\'c for
his persistent and patient guidance in the past few years.
He introduced me to the research of chaos, a fascinating field of
physics. And I learned a lot from him about turbulence theory,
cycle-averaging theory, group theory and so on. I really
appreciate the resources he is providing for graduate students
working at \emph{Center for Nonlinear Science} at \emph{Georgia Tech}.
Especially, I admire his attitude of regarding studying and researching
as lifetime habits.

At the same time, I thank everyone who has assisted my research.
I thank Prof. XXX for his valuable suggestions on the XXX
algorithm.
I thank my colleague Xiong Ding for XXX.
I thank my classmate Nazmi Burak Budanur for the
discussions of symmetry reduction.
I thank Mohammad Farazmand, Christopher Marcotte, Han Li,
Simon Berman, Kimberly Short,
Pallantla Ravi Kumar and other colleagues
for all the enlightening discussions.


At last, I thank my parents for insisting that I pursue
higher education, and the efforts they made to make it possible.
