Title: Spatiotemporal tiling of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.
Abstract :
Motivated by space-time translational invariance,
`spatiotemporally chaotic' or `turbulent' flows are recast
as a (D+1)-dimensional spatiotemporal theory which treats space and time equally.
In this formulation time evolution is replaced by
a repertoire of spatiotemporal patterns taking the form of (D+1) dimensional invariant tori.
Infinite space-time is then explained by the shadowing of these tori.
This is formalized by the development of a (D+1)-dimensional symbolic dynamics whose
alphabet is comprised of space-time tori of minimal size.
Enumerating these spatiotemporal building blocks enables
the construction of all admissible spatiotemporal patterns.
These ideas are investigated in the context of
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation using new, open source spatiotemporal computational 
computing package 'orbithunter'.
These codes are designed to offer easy access to new spatiotemporal techniques,
persistent homology, convolutional neural networks and more.
