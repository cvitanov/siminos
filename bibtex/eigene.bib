	title = {Relativistic breather-type solitary waves with linear polarization in cold plasmas},
	abstract = {Linearly polarized solitary waves, arising from the interaction of an intense laser pulse with a plasma, are investigated. New localized structures, in the form of exact, nonlinear solutions of the one-dimensional Maxwell-fluid model for a cold plasma with fixed ions are presented. Unlike stationary circularly polarized solitary waves, the linear polarization gives rise to a breather-like behavior and a periodic exchange of electromagnetic energy and electron kinetic energy at twice the frequency of the wave. A numerical method based on a finite-differences scheme allows to compute a branch of solutions within the frequency range \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{min\}{\textless}{\textbackslash}Omega{\textless}{\textbackslash}omega\_\{pe\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}omega\_\{pe\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{min\}\$ are the electron plasma frequency and the frequency value for which the plasma density vanishes locally, respectively. A detailed description of the spatio-temporal structure of the waves and their main properties as a function of \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ are presented. Small amplitude oscillations appearing in the tail of the solitary waves, a consequence of the linear polarization and harmonic excitation, are explained with the aid of the Akhiezer-Polovin system. Direct numerical simulations of the Maxwell-fluid model show that these solitary waves propagate without change for a long time.},

	abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of localized solutions of the relativistic cold-fluid plasma model in the small but finite amplitude limit, for slightly overcritical plasma density. Adopting a multiple scale analysis, we derive a perturbed nonlinear Schrödinger equation that describes the evolution of the envelope of circularly polarized electromagnetic field. Retaining terms up to fifth order in the small perturbation parameter, we derive a self-consistent framework for the description of the plasma response in the presence of localized electromagnetic field. The formalism is applied to standing electromagnetic soliton interactions and the results are validated by simulations of the full cold-fluid model. To lowest order, a cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a focusing nonlinearity is recovered. Classical quasiparticle theory is used to obtain analytical estimates for the collision time and minimum distance of approach between solitons. For larger soliton amplitudes the inclusion of the fifth-order terms is essential for a qualitatively correct description of soliton interactions. The defocusing quintic nonlinearity leads to inelastic soliton collisions, while bound states of solitons do not persist under perturbations in the initial phase or amplitude.},

In particular, we stress the importance of accounting for both the nonlinear frequency shift of the electron plasma wave and the growth of sidebands, in order to understand what stops the coherent growth of Raman scattering. Using a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal approach, we provide an estimate for the maximum amplitude reached by a {BSRS}-driven plasma wave after the phase of monotonic growth. This estimate is in very good agreement with the results from kinetic simulations of stimulated Raman scattering using both a Vlasov and a Particle in Cell code. Our analysis, which may be generalized to a multidimensional geometry, should provide a means to estimate the limits of backward Raman amplification or the effectiveness of strategies that aim at strongly reducing Raman reflectivity in a fusion plasma.},

The main properties of the waves as a function of their group velocities, wavevectors, and frequencies are studied, as well as bifurcations of the dynamical system that describes the waves when the parameter controlling the phase modulation changes from zero to a finite value.

A comparison of particle-in-cell simulations to the predictions of a relativistic cold-fluid model for the transparency threshold demonstrates that kinetic effects, such as electron heating, can lead to a substantial increase of the effective critical density compared to cold-fluid theory. These results are interpreted by a study of separatrices in the single-electron phase space corresponding to dynamics in the stationary fields predicted by the cold-fluid model. It is shown that perturbations due to electron heating exceeding a certain finite threshold can force electrons to escape into the vacuum, leading to laser pulse propagation. The modification of the transparency threshold is linked to the temporal pulse profile, through its effect on electron heating.},

From a mathematical point of view they are exact solutions of the one-dimensional relativistic cold fluid plasma model with nonvanishing boundary conditions. Under the assumption of travelling wave solutions with velocity V and vector potential frequency ω, the fluid model is reduced to a Hamiltonian system. The solitary waves are homoclinic (grey solitons) or heteroclinic (dark solitons) orbits to fixed points. Using a dynamical systems description of the Hamiltonian system and a spectral method, we identify a large variety of solitary waves, including asymmetric ones, discuss their disappearance for certain parameter values and classify them according to (i) grey or dark character, (ii) the number of humps of the vector potential envelope and (iii) their symmetries. The solutions come in continuous families in the parametric V–ω plane and extend up to velocities that approach the speed of light. The stability of certain types of grey solitary waves is investigated with the aid of particle-in-cell simulations that demonstrate their propagation for a few tens of the inverse of the plasma frequency.},

In either approach, numerical computations can be performed in the original state space representation, and the solutions are then projected onto the symmetry-reduced state space. The two methods are illustrated by reduction of the complex Lorenz system, a five-dimensional dissipative flow with rotational symmetry.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02582},
	abstract = {The existence of localized electromagnetic structures is discussed in the framework of the 1-dimensional relativistic Maxwell-fluid model for a cold plasma with immobile ions. New partially localized solutions are found with a finite-difference algorithm designed to locate numerically exact solutions of the Maxwell-fluid system. These solutions are called quasi-solitons and consist of a localized electromagnetic wave trapped in a spatially extended electron plasma wave. They are organized in families characterized by the number of nodes \$p\$ of the vector potential and exist in a continuous range of parameters in the \${\textbackslash}omega-V\$ plane, where \$V\$ is the velocity of propagation and \${\textbackslash}omega\$ is the vector potential angular frequency. A parametric study shows that the familiar fully localized relativistic solitons are special members of the families of partially localized quasi-solitons. Soliton solution branches with \$p{\textgreater}1\$ are therefore parametrically embedded in the continuum of quasi-solitons. On the other hand, geometric arguments and numerical simulations indicate that \$p=0\$ solitons exist only in the limit of either small amplitude or vanishing velocity. Direct numerical simulations of the Maxwell-fluid model indicate that the \$p{\textgreater}0\$ quasi-solitons (and embedded solitons) are unstable and lead to wake excitation, while \$p=0\$ quasi-solitons appear stable. This helps explain the ubiquitous observation of structures that resemble \$p=0\$ solitons in numerical simulations of laser-plasma interaction.},
