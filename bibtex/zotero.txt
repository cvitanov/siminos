\item[2010-01-07 ES] I'am leaning towards using tags rather than
collections to organize the content of my libraries. I've been using
collections for a while now and the main problem is that many papers can
fit to several collections. So I either have to copy papers to all
possible collections, or I end up having to browse through multiple
collections to find a paper.

The problem is that the web-interface does not display tags and does not
support search as far as I can tell. So one would have to use his zotero
client to access the papers in a sensible way. Furthermore since there is
no obvious organization it would be hard to browse the library. So I
think it would be better to use both tags and an organization to
collections.

\item[2010-05-12 ES] They have two levels for the attachments.
Links look like:

APS Full Text PDF  (pdf, 618 KB)

They provide details and the link by which the files were downloaded if
you press on APS Full Text PDF. They provide the stored copy of the file
if you press on (pdf, 618 KB). I find it easier to use the firefox add-on
to get the attachments though.
