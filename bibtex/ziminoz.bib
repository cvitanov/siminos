	abstract = {Transition to turbulence in pipe flow is one of the most fundamental and longest-standing problems in fluid dynamics. Stability theory suggests that the flow remains laminar for all flow rates, but in practice pipe flow becomes turbulent even at moderate speeds. This transition drastically affects the transport efficiency of mass, momentum, and heat. On the basis of the recent discovery of unstable traveling waves in computational studies of the {Navier-Stokes} equations and ideas from dynamical systems theory, a model for the transition process has been suggested. We report experimental observation of these traveling waves in pipe flow, confirming the proposed transition scenario and suggesting that the dynamics associated with these unstable states may indeed capture the nature of fluid turbulence.},

So far no explanation has been substantiated to rationalize the transition process by which the steady unidirectional laminar flow state gives way to a temporally and spatially disordered three-dimensional (turbulent) solution as the flow rate increases. Recently, new travelling wave solutions have been discovered which are saddle points in phase space. These plausibly represent the lowest level in a hierarchy of spatio-temporal periodic flow solutions which may be used to construct a cycle expansion theory of turbulent pipe flows. We summarize this success against the backdrop of past work and discuss its implications for future research.},

We evaluate several alternative methods for the approximation of inertial manifolds for the one-dimensional {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} equation {(KSE).} A method motivated by the dynamics originally developed for the {Navier-Stokes} equation is adapted for the {KSE.} Rigorous error estimates are obtained and compared to those of other methods introduced in the literature. Formal relationships between these other methods and the one introduced here are established. Numerical bifurcation diagrams of the various approximate inertial forms for the {KSE} are presented. We discuss the correspondence between the rigorous error estimates and the accuracy of the computational results. These methods can be adapted to other dissipative partial differential equations.},

The computations include detection of bifurcations and corresponding branch switching. A simple example is used to illustrate the main idea. Thereafter we compute families of periodic solutions of the circular restricted 3-body problem. We also continue the figure-8 orbit recently discovered by Chenciner and Montgomery, and numerically computed by Simu?o, as the mass of one of the bodies is allowed to vary. In particular, we show how the invariances (phase-shift, scaling law, and x, y, z translations and rotations) can be dealt with. Our numerical results show, among other things, that there exists a continuous path of periodic solutions from the figure-8 orbit to a periodic solution of the restricted 3-body problem.}

	abstract = {The {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} {(KS)} equation is known as a popular prototype to represent a system in which the transport of energy through nonlinear mode coupling produces a balance between long wavelength instability and short wavelength dissipation. Existing numerical results indicate that the {KS} equation admits three classes (namely, regular shock, oscillatory shock, and solitary wave) of nonperiodic traveling wave solutions and families of multiple solutions in each class. However, the details of multiple solutions are still unclear because of numerical accuracy. In this work, a rational spectral approach is used to compute these multiple traveling wave solutions. Owing to the high accuracy of the employed method, the new families of regular shock waves are found and the fine structure of each family is recognized.},

This manifold, which is invariant under the system evolution, was previously known and used to facilitate the discovery of attractors and bifurcations of such systems. The result of this paper establishes that attractors for the order parameter dynamics obtained by restriction to this reduced manifold are, in fact, the only such attractors of the full system. Thus all long time dynamical behavior of the order parameters of these systems can be obtained by restriction to the reduced manifold.},

Through extensive numerical simulation, we have characterized the transition to chaos of the solutions to the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} equation.

We present a large number of new geometric, ergodic and statistical properties of the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} equation modeling interfacial turbulence in various physical contexts. In addition, this equation has the remarkable property of inertial manifolds where some finite-dimensional dynamical system is rigorously equivalent to this infinite-dimensional partial differential equation. In moderate size domains (up to ten periods in length) a low-dimensional vector field skeleton underpins even strongly chaotic regimes and controls the bifurcations of the inertial manifold. The extreme numerical sensitivity of chaos in this dissipative {PDE} requires very high precision methods. Despite the geometrical complexities of the bifurcation structure, some statistical properties remain remarkably simple. There is overwhelming evidence that for some parameter values a permanent unsteady state exists. An unexpectedly simple diffusive relaxation of the large-scale fluctuations is extracted from extensive numerical simulations. In these calculations we observe long time tails for the correlation functions of relevant quantities. We propose an explanation in terms of an effective viscosity and compare the transport in the weakly turbulent interface with related theories for random interfaces and developed turbulence.},

The present dissertation is primarily interested in studying the appearance of global bifurcations in two specific physical examples, a laser with an injected signal, and a catalytic reaction on a platinum surface. Characteristic of these bifurcations is the presence of a highly degenerate .... One of the main motivations to study these equations is that some of them display spatiotemporal chaos, which in many ways, resembles turbulence in fluid dynamics. Recently, different efforts to uncover the dynamical origin for these complex states have been developing {(Goren} et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997).},
