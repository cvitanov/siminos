I am sure you will change these points anyway but I will keep
some notes here as I scroll through the overheads:

= You might want to talk about symmetry reduction in Lorenz
  example or even better substitute Lorenz with CLe?
  - PC: will do - but I'm going crazy az long as I am connected to
    the internet and Skype, there has been a minute to work on
    it. For example, there is Lippolis emergency, as grad students
    will work only a day before the deadline for delivering it to
    the GaTech Thesis Gestapo Lady. You should svn co it - you will
    feel like you have written both Illiad and Odyssey, by
    comparison.
