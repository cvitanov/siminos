Continuous symmetry reduction for high-dimensional flows


Abstract:

Recent advances in experimental imaging, computational methods, and
dynamical systems theory suggest that the unstable recurrent
coherent structures observed in wall-bounded shear flows (such as
pipes and boundary layers) result from close passes to weakly
unstable invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.

In presence of continuous translational and rotational symmetries
these equivariant solutions form 2- and 3-dimensional families of
equivalent traveling wave and relative periodic orbit solutions,
interconnected by a web of still higher-dimensional stable/unstable
manifolds, all embedded in the PDE infinite-dimensional state
spaces. In order to chart out this state space, one has to
quotient the symmetry, i.e. replace the dynamics by equivalent
reduced flow, in which each family of symmetry-related states is
replaced by a single representative.

Happy news: The problem has been solved often, first by Hilbert and
Weyl (1921), then by Cartan (1924), then by .... In the Hilbert
polynomial basis approach, the equivariant dynamics is rewritten in
terms of invariant coordinates (replace vector x by its length x^2,
etc.). In Cartan's method the state space is sliced in such
a way that each group orbit of symmetry-equivalent points is
represented by a single point.

Still, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way: The Hilbert
polynomial bases are computationally unfeasible for dimensions
larger than ten. Moving frame slices are local, a generic global
trajectory encounters singularities within a slice, and many
slices might be needed to capture the flow globally.
