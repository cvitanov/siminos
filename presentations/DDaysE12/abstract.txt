Continuous symmetry reduction in high-dimensional flows
with the method of slices

In presence of continuous symmetries, solutions of high-dimensional flows
come in families of equivalent states, related by a group transformation.
In order to understand the topological organization of such flows in
terms of dynamically important solutions, one needs to replace the
dynamics by a symmetry reduced flow, in which all symmetry related states
are replaced by a single representative.

Classical symmetry reduction schemes, such as the Hilbert polynomial
basis approach are computationally prohibitive in high-dimensional flows.
In the method of slices, which we will employ here, the reduced space is
identified with a collection of local charts, each being a hyperplane
segment which intersects group-orbits transversely. We will demonstrate
the method in three systems of physical relevance: 1) the 5-dimensional,
SO(2)-equivariant complex Lorenz flow, 2) the 4-dimensional
SO(2)-equivariant Porter-Knobloch system and 3) the O(2)-equivariant
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky partial differential equation.

Will list me and Predrag as authors in online submission, the rest
will be listed as collaborators in the talk/poster.

I will only use CLe and KSe as examples (nothing interesting came yet
out of Porter-Knobloch). First part of the talk will introduce the
problem and the method using CLe as example. Second part 
will be devoted to KSe, showing how slicing can help us understand
shadowing of RPOs and (maybe) that the unstable manifold of 
an RPO organizes other RPOs. I will only show single chart 
examples and mention atlas12 paper (plan for arxiv?). If the talk
turns out to be too short I will show 2-chart reduction of CLe
(multiple chart reduction for KSe does not work yet).

There should be not too much of a collision - I'll work my talk around
yours, once you write it up. The abstract is vague:

title:     Charting the state space of turbulent  flows
author:    P. Cvitanovic

Advances in experimental imaging, computational methods, and dynamical
systems theory reveal that the unstable recurrent coherent structures
observed in moderate Reynolds number turbulent flows result from close
passes to unstable invariant solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. These
3D, fully nonlinear solutions -equilibria, traveling waves, and
(relative) periodic orbits- structure the infinite-dimensional state
space of turbulent flows and provide a skeleton for analyzing their
dynamics.

However, with dynamics in high-dimensional state spaces come new
challenges - we will discuss two. (1) Flows of interest (pipe, channel
flows) often come equipped with continuous symmetries. Just to get
started with charting out their state spaces, one first has to quotient
the symmetries, i.e., replace the flow by an equivalent, symmetry reduced
flow, in which each family of symmetry-related states is replaced by a
single representative. Doing this well remains a challenge. (2) Having
started, one also needs to know when to stop. We argue that for a given
physical system there is always `optimal resolution' of the state space,
beyond which there is nothing more to be done.
