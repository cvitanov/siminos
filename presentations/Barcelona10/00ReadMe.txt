Minisymposium
Dynamical systems and the onset of turbulence in shear flows
MS Code: 46
Organizer: Marc Avila Canellas

The speakers, tentative titles (in this order): 
Predrag
- Dynamical systems and the onset of turbulence in shear flows 
Ashley
- Method of the moving frames: the state space of pipe flow 
Bjoern
- From localized to expanding  turbulence 
Alvaro
- Large scale coherent turbulent-laminar structures 

Predrag overview talk to open the minisymposium, 
The phase pace of plane Couette. 
Introduce symmetry reduction.
Motivate the moving frames method when looking at pipe flow,
and fits well to the Ashley talk.
We will fine tune the distribution of the symmetry reduction overheads later.

Ashley would follow with phase space visualization in pipe flows (with the moving frames method), 
Bjoern would then speak on the transition from localized to expanding turbulence in pipes, ducts and channels (including lifetimes), 
Alvaro would speak about large scale coherent structures (spiral turbulence in Taylor Couette).
