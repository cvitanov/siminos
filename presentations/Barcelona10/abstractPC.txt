Title:
State-space visualization
of the onset of turbulence in shear flows

Abstract:
Recent advances in experimental imaging, computational methods,
and dynamical systems theory suggest that the unstable recurrent
coherent structures observed in wall-bounded shear flows (such
as pipes and boundary layers) result from close passes to weakly
unstable invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.
These 3D, fully nonlinear solutions (equilibria and periodic
orbits) structure the state space of turbulent flows and provide
a skeleton for analyzing their dynamics. In presence of
continuous translational and rotational symmetries the
corresponding invariant solutions are relative equilibria
(traveling waves) and relative periodic orbits. We describe the
method of slices or moving frames, which reduces the state space
to a symmetry-reduced `slice'. The reduction enables us to chart
out the connections between these `relative' or `equivariant'
solutions in the state-space representation introduced in
(Gibson, Halcrow and Cvitanovic, JFM 2008), and examine their
role in organizing the dynamics of turbulence.
