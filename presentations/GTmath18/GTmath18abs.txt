Recent advances in fluid dynamics reveal that the recurrent flows
observed in moderate Reynolds number turbulence result from close
passes to unstable invariant solutions of Navier-Stokes equations.
By now hundreds of such solutions been computed for a variety of
flow geometries, but always confined to small computational domains
(minimal cells).

Pipe, channel and plane flows, however, are flows on infinite
spatial domains. We propose to recast the Navier-Stokes equations
as a space-time theory, with the unstable invariant solutions now
being the space-time tori (and not the 1-dimensional periodic
orbits of the classical periodic orbit theory). The symbolic
dynamics is likewise higher-dimensional (rather than a single
temporal string of symbols). In this theory there is no time, there
is only a repertoire of admissible spatiotemporal patterns.

We illustrate the strategy by solving a very simple classical field
theory model arising from studies of many-particle quantum chaos, a
discretized screened Poisson equation, or the ``spatiotemporal
cat.'' No actual cats, graduate or undergraduate, have shown
interest in, or were harmed during this research.
