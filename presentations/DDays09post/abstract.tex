\begin{abstract}

The usual approach to symmetry reduction in dynamical systems is through rewriting the equations in a symmetry-invariant polynomial basis (Hilbert basis), the determination of which becomes computationally prohibitive as the dimension of the system increases. As our goal is to quotient continuous symmetries of high-dimensional flows, specifically those arising from truncations of the Kuramoto-Shivasinsky and Navier-Stokes flows, we propose a novel approach to continuous symmetry reduction which can be implemented efficiently without any rewriting of the equivariant equations governing the flow.

As an example, we apply the method to the ``Complex Lorenz system,'' a 5-dimensional, $SO(2)$-symmetric truncation of Maxwell-Bloch equations for a detuned ring laser. Our procedure reduces the 5-dimensional dynamics to an 1-dimensional return map that enables us to systematically label and determine all relative periodic orbits up to a given period.
