The recurrent flows observed in moderate Reynolds number turbulence
are shaped by close passes to unstable invariant solutions of
Navier-Stokes equations. While in recent years many such solutions
been computed, so far all have been confined to small computational
domains.

Pipe, channel and plane flows, however, are flows on infinite
spatial domains. If the Navier-Stokes equations are recast as a
space-time theory, with both space and time taken to infinity, the
traditional Direct Numerical Simulation codes have to be abandoned.
In this theory there is no time, there is only a repertoire of
admissible spatiotemporal patterns. To determine these, radically
different kinds of codes will have to be written, with space and
time treated on equal footing: some of the possible approaches will
be sketched.
