Recent advances in fluid dynamics reveal that the recurrent flows
observed in moderate Reynolds number turbulence result from close
passes to unstable invariant solutions of Navier-Stokes equations.
By now hundreds of such solutions been computed for a variety of
flow geometries, but always confined to small computational domains
(minimal cells).

The 2016 Gutkin and Osipov paper on many-particle quantum chaos
opens a path to determining such solutions on spatially infinite
domains. Flows of interest (pipe, channel flows) often come
equipped with D continuous spatial symmetries. If the theory is
recast as a (D+1)-dimensional space-time theory, the space-time
invariant solutions are (D+1)-tori (and not the 1-dimensional
periodic orbits of the traditional periodic orbit theory). The
symbolic dynamics is likewise (D+1)-dimensional (rather than a
single temporal string of symbols), and the corresponding zeta
functions should be sums over tori, rather than 1-dimensional
periodic orbits. In this theory there is no time, there is only a
repertoire of admissible spatiotemporal patterns.
