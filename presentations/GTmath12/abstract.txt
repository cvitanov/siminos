Abstract:

With recent advances in experimental imaging, computational methods, and
dynamics insights it is now possible to start charting out the terra
incognita explored by turbulence in strongly nonlinear classical field
theories, such as fluid flows. In presence of continuous symmetries these
solutions sweep out 2- and higher-dimensional manifolds (group orbits) of
physically equivalent states, interconnected by a web of still
higher-dimensional stable/unstable manifolds, all embedded in the PDE
infinite-dimensional state spaces. In order to chart such invariant
manifolds, one must first quotient the symmetries, i.e. replace the
dynamics on M by an equivalent, symmetry reduced flow on M/G, in which
each group orbit of symmetry-related states is replaced by a single
representative.

Happy news: The problem has been solved often, first by Jacobi (1846),
then by Hilbert and Weyl (1921), then by Cartan (1924), then by [...],
then in this week's arXiv [...]. Turns out, it's not as easy as it looks.

Still, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way: The Hilbert's
solution (invariant polynomial bases) is useless. The way we do this in
quantum field theory (gauge fixing) is not right either. Currently only
the "method of slices" does the job: it slices the state space by a set
of hyperplanes in such a way that each group orbit manifold of
symmetry-equivalent points is represented by a single point, but as
slices are only local, tangent charts, an atlas comprised from a set of
charts is needed to capture the flow globally. Lots of work and not a
pretty sight (Nature does not like symmetries), but one is rewarded by
much deeper insights into turbulent dynamics; without this atlas you will
not get anywhere.

This is not a fluid dynamics talk. If you care about atomic, nuclear or
celestial physics, general relativity or quantum field theory you might
be interested and perhaps help us do this better.
