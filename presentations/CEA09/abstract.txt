Dynamical systems and turbulence: unstable periodic orbits

State-space geometry of a Kuramoto-Sivashinsky flow in terms of relative periodic orbits 
Evangelos Siminos and Predrag Cvitanovic, Georgia Institute of Technology; Ruslan L. Davidchack, University of Leicester, United Kingdom 


The long-time dynamics of a chaotic
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky flow on a periodic domain is organized by its
unstable equilibria, traveling waves, periodic and relative periodic
orbits and their stable/unstable manifolds. Quotienting by the
O(2) continuous symmetry renders relative periodic orbits periodic, 
reducing dynamics to mappings between a set of Poincare sections. 
The hierarchy of periodic orbits so obtained will enable us to calculate 
long-time averages of physical quantities such as  dissipation rates.
