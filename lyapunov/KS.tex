\begin{description}
\item[2009-09-13 Predrag]
  Sure looks persuasive, see \reffig{fig:lyapSpec}. I have also
  added stability of a periodic orbit from
  \refref{Christiansen97}, for KS on the periodic b.c.,
  antisymmetric subspace, system size $\tilde{L} = 5.8$ close
  to the onset of chaos, 16 real Fourier modes. As (perhaps?)
  discussed in \refref{lanCvit07}, one has to be careful about
  defining the effective system size $\tilde{L}$ for the
  antisymmetric subspace, so these computations are done on
  $L=36.31$ (or $L = 18.155$ if one considers the fundamental
  $[0,L/2]$ domain only). Going from $(L,\nu) =
  (2\pi,0.029924)$ of \refref{Christiansen97} to $(L,\nu) =
  (L,1)$ convention used here requires that the time be
  rescaled as $t \to \nu t$, and the Lyapunov exponents as
  $\lambda_i \to \lambda_i/ \nu = \lambda_i/ 0.029924 $, so -60
  in the Lyapunov scale of \reffig{fig:lyapSpec}\,(a)
  corresponds to approx. -1.8 on the scale of
  \reffig{fig:lyapSpec}\,(b), which would mean that then we
  computed only the first pair of isolated eigenvalues. The
  reason is that for periodic orbits we are computing {\em
    Floquet multipliers} which underflow numerically very
  quickly, so we cannot compute many {\em Floquet exponents}.
  These {\cLv} methods are apparently
  much smarter.

  In \refref{lanCvit07} computations are done at $L = 38.5$,
  but we listed only 4 eigenvalues per periodic orbit, and
  considering hopeless organizational skills on the Lan astral
  plane, I doubt that the full spectra can be rescued from
  Lan's calculations. And, as explained above, probably we cannot
  compute them for periodic orbits.

\item[2009-09-13 Ruslan]
  Here's the expanded list of Lyapunov exponents for KS with $L = 22$:
  0.048,    0.0,    0.0,   -0.003,   -0.189,   -0.256,   -0.290,   -0.310,
  -1.963,   -1.967,   -5.605,   -5.605,  -11.923,  -11.923...
  So, there appears to be 8 `physically relevant' exponents and
  the rest are pairs of hyperbolically separated ones.

  I read
  the papers about these {\cLvs} and I'm not
  sure I understand how they are related to eigenvectors at
  periodic orbits: are they aligned?  I suspect that not quite,
  apart from the most expanding and the most contracting
  direction, the rest are sitting somewhere within the
  subspaces spanned by the $k$ most expanding, or $m$ most
  contracting eigendirections, but not quite aligned with the
  eigendirections themselves.  That's probably why they are
  more appropriately called `Lyapunov vectors'.

\item[2009-09-14 Predrag]
  The `{\cLvs}' are indeed the (right,
  non-orthogonal) eigenvectors of the \jacobianM\ \jMps, as
  defined in ChaosBook, and coincide with Floquet eigenvectors
  for a periodic orbit.

\item[Ruslan] I use 32 complex Fourier modes, so the
  truncated system has 62 degrees of freedom.  The Lyapunov
  exponent calculation is standard (using Gram-Schmidt).  The
  exponents are the same, independent of the method of
  calculation.  I have not attempted to calculate the {\cLvs}. I'm pretty sure that
  orthogonality between {\entangled} and isolated eigenvectors
  applies, but have not checked.

\item[Ruslan]
  It's OK to I email Hong-liu Yang\rf{YaTaGiChRa08}, ask him to rerun his
  {\cLv} spectrum for $L=22$, to see whether he agrees with us.

\item[2009-09-12 Ruslan]
  I have the 62 eigenvalues/eigenvectors for all the RPO/PPO
  I've detected, but for the highly contracting eigenvalues
  the straightforward calculation
  suffers from the numerical noise. We need a
  better method to compute Floquet multipliers. I have now
  checked:   Looks like {Kurt Lust} has proposed one, but I
  cannot get his paper on ``Improved Numerical Floquet
  Multipliers''\rf{Lust01}. If you could
  get it for me, it would be great.
  \phantomsection\label{2013-11-18XD}

\item[2009-09-13 Ruslan]
  ``Structure of characteristic Lyapunov
  vectors in spatiotemporal chaos''\rf{PaSzLoRo09} states
  that characteristic Lyapunov vectors ``reduce to the Floquet
  eigenvectors for a periodic orbit'' and references Trevisan
  and Pancotti\rf{TrePan98}, which I cannot get electronically.

\item[2009-09-14 Predrag]
  I added abstracts of these papers to the reading list above.
  The `{\cLvs}' are indeed the (right,
  non-orthogonal) eigenvectors of the \jacobianM\ \jMps, as
  defined in ChaosBook, and coincide with Floquet eigenvectors
  for a periodic orbit. For a flow they are defined at a given
  \statesp\ point by going back and forward a finite, but
  `sufficiently long' time $t$, and coincide with the Floquet
  eigenvectors if the point is (relative) periodic. I believed
  that for a PDE we cannot go backward, but was wrong; the do
  it by using the segment of forward trajectory stored in
  memory. The reason why one can get the Floquet {\em exponent}
  for arbitrarily long orbit is that the multiplier for eigenvector
  evolved in time is just a number, so taking its logarithm over
  short time segments and
  storing it is trivial, no underflow problems one would get if
  one worked with the Floquet {\em multiplier}. So we should be able
  to keep track of all 62 eigenvectors, redo it for 126 eigenvectors,
  and compare with plots in \refref{YaTaGiChRa08}.
  Ginelli \etal\rf{ginelli-2007-99} are the main
  reference on the `{\cLvs}.' They describe
  the QR algorithm for computing Gram-Schmidt vectors (GSV) and
  recovering the {\cLvs} (CLV) from them.
  What confuses me is that so far all papers refer to $\Lyap_j
  = \eigRe_j + i \, \eigIm_j$ as purely real, and list only
  $\eigRe_j$, but I guess that will be explained somewhere.

\item[2009-09-14 Predrag]
  My initial \reffig{fig:lyapSpec} was not optimal; I have now
  replotted it as in Fig.~4 of
  Yang \etal\rf{YaTaGiChRa08},
  agrees with their 'extensivity' plot for $L=96$ and $192$.

  I prefer $x$-axis to be $j/\tildeL = 2 \pi j/L$, as in
  \reffig{fig:lyapSpecRscld}.

  I do not like the way they count eigenvalues:  due to the $\On{2}$
  2-dimensional irreducible representations
  one should group their $j,j+1$ pairs,
  plot them as a single, two-valued $j$, as in
  \reffig{fig:lyapSpecRscld}. What one chooses to pair for low
  $j$ might be ambiguous, as the nonlinear interactions mix up
  the $\On{2}$ 2-dimensional linearly irreducible representations.
  Reploted as in our much ignored 1997 paper\rf{Christiansen97},
  eigenvalues fall onto $ (2 \pi j/L)^2 - (2 \pi j/L)^4 $
  \eqv\ $\EQV{0}$  stability curve.
  The isolated `{\cLvs}'
  are damped by $-(2 \pi j/L)^4$. I worry that we will not have such
  amicable divorce for plane Couette and pipe flows...

    \label{fig:lyapSpecRscld}

  We also see
  that the `{\entangled}' Lyapunov vectors are split into a less contracting 1/2
  and more contracting 1/2 (different slopes in the
  \reffig{fig:lyapSpecRscld}\,(a)). We
  used to think the first 1/2 is the physically important one,
  and say so in the arXiv version 2 of the article.
  We stand corrected.

  The Floquet eigenvectors of our (relative) periodic orbits are
  what they call 'covariant,' so they should fit into their finite back/forth
  time vectors like into a glove, whenever the respective state space
  points are sufficiently close.

  The main point of exploring the ergodic states space hierarchically
  by periodic orbits is to tessellate it systematically, in the most
  uniform way, by neighborhoods (linearized stable/unstable manifolds)
  of periodic points. A periodic solution computed on a small system
  size $L$, periodic b.c. is a solution on any multiple of $L$, and it comes
  together with a smooth family of corresponding solutions for nearby
  $L$'s.

  I see prospects of a long and happy marriage here.

\item[2011-02-04 ES] Talked to Hugues Chat\'{e} and Kazumasa Takeuchi.
  I was at CEA/Saclay for a thesis presentation today, bumped into Chat\'{e}
  and
  \HREF{http://daisy.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/student/kazumasa/}{Kazz}
  (actually, it was more like invading their offices). Kazz updated me on
  their latest work on Lyapunov vectors. We finally all agreed that we would give
  the periodic orbit - Lyapunov vectors project a second try and arrange to meet
  in Paris. I'll keep you posted.


\item[2011-02-07 ES] Sent Kazz an initial condition for a KS, $L=22$ \po\
  \PO{10.25}.


\item[2011-02-09 Kazz] I tried your initial condition and it works perfectly!
  I also tried to calculate the Lyapunov exponents associated to this {\po}.
  The largest is about 0.03328, right? I'm not yet really sure about this value,
  so it would be nice if you let me know the Lyapunov exponents you know for this {\po}.

\item[2011-02-11 ES] The Lyapunov exponent I have is 0.033163, so you
  are pretty close. In fact this exponent has multiplicity two, and
  there is no other positive exponent for this orbit.

\item[2011-02-11 Kazz] Great! All you are saying (multiplicity, only two positive
  exponents) are exactly what I confirmed with that {\po}. I will soon have all
  the necessary information regarding the {\entangled}/{\transient} Lyapunov vectors for that {\po}.

\item[2011-02-11 Kazz] Which quantities / properties do you have
  analytically / numerically for these \po s in your methods? For instance,
  if we know the time evolution  for a {\po}, we can compute both
  Lyapunov exponents and {\cLvs} as eigenvalues and
  eigenvectors of that operator. Do you have them? Or, the exponent values
  you have are just computed by Bennetin's standard algorithm?

  \renewcommand{\ssp}{x}

\item[2011-02-11 ES] We do not use Bennetin's method, but rather
  something similar to what you just described. However, I am not sure how
  you exactly define the time evolution, so I will describe with
  details what we do (see \refrem{rem:Lyapunov} on \refpage{rem:Lyapunov} above).

  Given an initial condition $\xInit$ and period $\period{p}$ of the prime
  \po\ $p$, we integrate
  the differential equations for the nonlinear flow
  $d\ssp/dt=v(\ssp)$, and a differential equation for the \jacobianM\
  from $t=0$ to $\period{p}$,:
  \beq
  \deltaX(t) = \jMps^t(\xInit) \deltaX_0
  \,, \qquad
  \jMps^t_{ij}(\xInit)
  =  \left. {\pde \ssp_i(t) \over \pde \ssp_j} \right|_{\ssp=\xInit}
  \, .
  \label{hOdes1}
  \eeq
  \beq
  {d\over dt}\jMps^t(\xInit)
  = {\Mvar}(\ssp) \, \jMps^t(\xInit)
  \,, \quad
  \mbox{initial condition~~} \jMps^0(\xInit) = \matId
  \,.
  \ee{Bew_Miaw}
  The {\stabmat} (\velgradmat)
  \beq
  {\Mvar}_{ij}(\ssp) ={\pde \vel_i(\ssp)\over \pde \ssp_j  }
  \ee{DerMatrix1}
  describes the instantaneous rate of shearing of the infinitesimal
  neighborhood of $\ssp=\ssp(t)$
  by the flow.
  We write for its
  eigen\-vectors $\jEigvec[j]$
  (sometimes referred to as `{\cLvs},'
  or, for \po s, as `Floquet vectors')
  \beq
  \jMps_{p}(\ssp)\, \jEigvec[j](\ssp)
  = \ExpaEig_{p,j} \,\jEigvec[j] (\ssp)
  \,,\qquad
  \ExpaEig_{p,j}
  = \sign{p}^{(j)} e^{\eigExp[j]_p \period{p} }
  \,.
  \ee{cplxExpaEig2}
  where $\eigExp[j]_p = \eigRe[j]_p \pm i\eigIm[j]_p$
  and $\sign{p}^{(j)}$ are independent of
  $\ssp$.
  The time-dependent
  $\period{}$-periodic vector fields, such
  as the flow linearized around a \po, are
  described by Floquet theory. Hence
  we refer to a \jacobianM\
  evaluated on a periodic orbit either as
  a {\em \FloquetM} or a {\em monodromy matrix}, to its
  eigenvalues
  $\ExpaEig_{p,j}$ as Floquet multipliers,
  % \refeq{cplxExpaEig2},
  and to $\eigExp[j]_p = \eigRe[j]_p+i\eigIm[j]_p$ as Floquet or
  characteristic exponents.



  The eigenvalues $\ExpaEig_i$ of $\jMps^t(\xInit)$ are
  the Floquet multipliers and its eigenvectors the Floquet eigenvectors
  (the {\cLvs} for \po s).

  Then the $i$th `Lyapunov' exponent is the real part
  $\eigRe[i] = \ln(|\ExpaEig_i|)/ T$ of the Floquet exponent..
  Although we only have the eigenvalues in file, I could easily compute
  the eigenvectors for comparison.

  The problem with this approach is that, while we believe the leading
  eigenvalues to be accurate, the highly contracting ones suffer from
  numerical noise. So it would be hard for us to separate {\entangled} from
  isolated eigenvectors based on this computation alone.


\item[2011-02-11 Kazz] Thank you for the explanation. That is exactly what
  I meant by eigenvalues of the time evolution operator.

  I compute the Lyapunov exponents (and the {\cLvs})
  by Benettin's method (and by Ginelli's one). The only trick is that, each time
  the trajectory $\ssp(t)$ returns to its original position $\ssp(0)$, \ie, at every cycle
  of the orbit, I replace $\ssp(t)$ by its initial value $\ssp(0)$. This is to kill
  numerical noise that would grow and eventually kick the trajectory
  out of the periodic orbit. This method is accurate even for very small
  exponent values.

  \renewcommand{\ssp}{a}

\item[2011-03-10 Predrag] That's OK for the shortest orbits, but
  for longer orbits it will have to be replaced by either section $\to$
  section traversals (see multi-shooting in
  \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/paper.shtml\#cycles}{ChaosBook.org}) or variational methods (see
  \refref{CvitLanCrete02} and
  \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/paper.shtml\#relax}{ChaosBook.org}).

  Meantime I show you how my code integrates your {\po}
  (the first three in your
  list), \reffig{kaz-evolution}. Indeed, I cannot integrate
  it even during one period for the second one, which has a large
  Floquet multiplier.

  By the way, the prime period indicated in the file is half the
  full \statesp\ period?
  The space-time plot indicates that...

\item[2011-02-18 ES]
  Yes, this is the convention we follow in our paper\rf{SCD07}, sorry for not
  bringing this to your attention. We define the period $T_p$ to be the
  smallest time such that $u(x+T_p)=\gamma u(x,0)$, where $\gamma$ a
  discrete symmetry transformation (here reflection $R$), see eq. (2.22) in
  our paper and the discussion that follows it. All periodic orbits we
  have found are thus pre-periodic, or \rpo s.
  \PC{really all are \rpo s? I thought about 1/2 of this 40,000 -
    60,000 were not?}
  The evolution
  $T_p$ to $2T_p$ is a repeat of the pre-periodic orbit which
  is periodic in this case, as $R^2=1$ (and thus we can take the period to be $T_p$
  rather than $2T_p$). You should take advantage of this
  when computing Lyapunov exponents, integrating only from $0$ to $T_p$ and
  then applying $R$ to $u(x,0)$ to get a new initial condition, before
  integrating from $T_p$ to $2T_p$ and so on. I should have mentioned this
  convention, but it is by now second nature to me.

  By the way, what method do you use for integration? For the third
  orbit, could you please compute $||u(x,2T_p)-u(x,0)||$ (or
  $||u(x,T_p)-Ru(x,0)||$ where $R$ is reflection)? The choice of norm should
  not be crucial. I ask because I think this is the best indicator of
  reproducibility of the periodic orbits. For the second orbit, if you
  could compute $||u(x,T_p)-Ru(x,0)||$, it might tell us that the
  difference is not as large as the figure suggests.

  Thanks for the kind explanation. I should have read your
  paper more carefully... I shall do this very soon.

  Here I attach a figure, \reffig{kaz-evolution2}, showing
  how a measure of the distance between a
  trajectory and an orbit grows in time. The same trajectories and the orbits
  as in the figure I send you last Friday are used. The dashed lines are the
  growth rate expected from their Floquet multipliers and agree well with the
  actual growth of the distance. Indeed, even for the second orbit the trajectory
  stays close to it up to time $~2T_p$.

\item[2011-02-22 ES] In the last set of figures (evolution2.pdf), is $u(x,t)$
  an orbit resulting from perturbing the initial condition of the periodic orbit?

\item[2011-02-23 Kazz] Concerning your question, the initial condition for u(x,t)
  is exactly the one you sent to us. Just I integrated it and measured how
  it deviates from the orbit because of the numerical noise.


\item[2011-02-20 Predrag] to Kazz:
  I'm very glad that you and Evangelos are looking at the KS periodic solutions.
  Attached is \refsect{sect:LyapKS} from out blog
  (you probably have this already, but
  I am not quite sure) - if you plot all cycle Floquet multipliers, can you try to
  also plot them in the way suggested in my notes (it differs a bit from how you
  had plotted them in Yang \etal\ paper\rf{YaTaGiChRa08})?
  I was pleasantly surprised how well one
  could see the {\entangled}/isolated boundary already for $L=22$.

  I (with spirits of Hugues Chat\'e and Francesco Ginelli hovering above me)
  have integrated some of
  them and computed a number of quantities to elucidate the
  {\entangled}/isolated separation of Lyapunov vectors. Here I show a
  summary of preliminary results. I also have some questions to ask you
  (see the end of the mail for them).


  \textbf{Results}

  Here we concentrate on (1) a chaotic trajectory generated from a random
  initial condition, and (2) the first periodic orbit \PO{10.25},
  $\period{p}=10.25336729174627$ in the list
  Evangelos sent to me (called "{\po}a" in the attached
  figures). The numerical integration of the {unstable \po} is done by replacing the
  trajectory on each period by the initial condition of the {unstable \po}.
  \PC{to Evangelos - do we have a naming convention in \refref{SCD09b}
    and/or \refref{SiminosThesis} that we could follow here,
    instead of renaming every \po? {\bf ES:} No. We use
    $(T_p,\ell_p)=(.,.)$ to refer to a \rpo.}

  show the Lyapunov spectrum for
  the trajectory and the {unstable \po}.

  For the {unstable \po} the exponents are
  given by the Floquet multipliers, as indeed confirmed quantitatively,
  while for the chaotic trajectory they are different from but close to
  those of the {unstable \po}, \refFig{fig:lyapSpec1}\,(b).
  % (top right figure).
  Increasing the index, we
  see the appearance of the step-wise structure (top left figure) like in
  our Yang \etal\rf{YaTaGiChRa08} PRL.

  \refFig{kaz2-PhysModes-cd} shows the hyperbolic isolation of the {\entangled} and
  isolated Lyapunov vectors (similar to frames (d) and (e) in \reffig{fig:lyapSpecCLG}
  from our PRL); they
  CANNOT be defined solely from the Lyapunov exponents.). The quality of
  the data is not satisfactory because of the present length of the
  simulation, but we can see that there are at most 11 {\entangled} Lyapunov vectors.


  \refFig{kaz4-VectCompar} compares the {\cLvs} on the
  chaotic trajectory with the Floquet vectors of the {unstable \po}. I monitored the
  chaotic trajectory and used the instant when it gets closest to the {unstable \po}
  during the simulation. The inset of the top left figure shows the
  snapshot of the trajectory (blue) and the {unstable \po} (red) at that instant.

  The other three subpanels compare the vector structure at the same
  instant. Here the spatial shift between blue and red is already taken
  into account, so that you can directly compare the two profiles. The
  bottom two figures show the 6th and 9th Lyapunov vectors, which correspond to
  real-valued Floquet multipliers of the {unstable \po} (thus Oseledec subspace is
  not degenerated). We can see that the vectors of the chaotic trajectory
  become quite close to the {unstable \po} counterparts (but not exactly; some are
  better, others are not as good). For the Lyapunov vectors that correspond
  to complex conjugate pairs of the Floquet multipliers, e.g. 1st and 2nd
  ones, we have to compare a vector of the trajectory with arbitrary
  linear combinations of the 1st and 2nd {unstable \po} vectors. Indeed, we can find
  a combination that gives a structure similar to the vector of the
  trajectory.

  In short, as a chaotic trajectory wanders among {unstable \po}s, the vectors of the
  trajectory change their shape incessantly to follow the vectors of the
  closest {unstable \po} at each instant.


  Now, the question is whether we can unambiguously define the {\entangled}
  and isolated Lyapunov vectors for each periodic orbit, or not. We don't know how to
  do this, because the angle between any Lyapunov vectors
  of {unstable \po} varies periodically and thus does not reach 0 or
  $\pi$ forever.

  Moreover, we find that the hyperbolicity properties crucially depend on
  the quality of the periodic orbit. See
  \reffig{kaz5-AngleTimeSeries}, which shows
  time-series of angles between given pairs of the Lyapunov vectors of the
  {unstable \po}. Although the angle between Lyapunov vectors of index $\geq 11$ (correspond
  to isolated Lyapunov vectors for the chaotic trajectory) stays close to $\pi/2$ with a
  seemingly trivial time-evolution, the numerically computed angle is not
  strictly $\pi/2$ and is subject to a very slow convergence (see the middle
  panel). To test, I added a noise to the initial condition of the {unstable \po} and
  computed the same quantities. While the angles for index $\leq 10$ do not
  show significant changes, those for index $\geq 11$ show {\transient}
  oscillations with long periods.

  This is why we think that the quality of the periodic orbit is crucial.
  It could be that, if we had an initial condition with infinite
  precision, the angle for index $\geq 11$ are strictly orthogonal, and thus we
  could define the isolated Lyapunov vectors from this strict orthogonality.


  \textbf{Questions}

  1) We wonder if we may define the {\entangled} and isolated Lyapunov vectors for
  periodic orbits. Do you have any ideas, in particular from the viewpoint
  of the Floquet multipliers and eigenvectors?

  2) As shown above, the quality of the {unstable \po} initial conditions turns out
  to be crucial. Do you have data with better resolutions? Or, is it
  numerically difficult to compute {unstable \po}s with very high resolutions?

  That's all for now. Any comments / questions are of course welcome!


  \textbf{Kazz to Predrag} I made a plot of the Lyapunov spectrum of
  the {unstable \po} (the same one as above) in the same way as you did. See \reffig{kaz{\po}a}
  and {\po}a-lyap.dat (below). I hope this is the one you wanted.

\item[2011-03-05 Predrag to Kazz] I do not understand your \po\ calculations.
  For this short orbit I expect everything - all Floquet multipliers and
  Floquet vectors to be good to a machine precision, or at least to - let's say -
  $10^{-6}$?

\item[2011-03-05 Predrag]
  I find
  \reffig{fig:lyapSpec1}\,(b) amazing. The {\po} \PO{10.25} is
  only exploring the $\infty$-dimensional \statesp\ as the
  shortest 1-dimensional loop, while the chaotic trajectory is
  wondering over the whole 11-dimensional (say Parisians) strange attractor
  (inertial manifold) and still the entangled eigenvalues are so close.

\item[2011-03-07 Hugues]
  That's because the {\po} \PO{10.25} is the least unstable of all
  \po s.

\item[2011-03-07 Predrag] Easy to say, but in \refref{SCD07} we have
  not noticed any concentration of the natural measure in the neighborhood of
  this \po. That is perhaps because we have not quotiented
  $\pS \to \pSRed = \pS/\SOn{2}$, and $\SOn{2}$ drifts can easily
  mask a much simpler strange attractor\rf{SiCvi10,FrCv11}.


\item[2011-03-04 Evangelos]
  I really can't follow this tessellation idea. My motivation to be
  involved with this project at this point developed while reading Roweis
  and Saul\rf{RoSa00}. I believe what we ought to do should be very close
  to their way of thinking: construct linear local charts (bases) and then
  bring them together to construct a global curvilinear embedding. In
  contrast to their pattern recognition, empirical way to construct the
  local charts, we can use information from the {\cLvs}.

\item[2011-03-05 Predrag]
  I agree in principle.
  See also {\bf [2010-12-06 PC]} in \texttt{siminos/blog/atlas.tex}

\item[2011-03-04 Evangelos]
  I would prefer to work with \KS\ in the antisymmetric subspace, so that we do not
  have to worry about the translational symmetry (remember that the periodic
  orbits for $L=22$ are in the full space, rather that in the antisymmetric
  subspace).

\item[2011-03-07 Hugues]
  I agree, shifts are killing us.

\item[2011-03-05 Predrag]
  I agree.
  \PCedit{
    [revised 2011-03-10: I disagree, see comment below]
  }


\item[2011-03-04 Evangelos]
  The local charts can be provided by the {\entangled} {\cLvs} computed on a set of the most important \po s. Then we only need
  to implement the final step in the procedure of Roweis and
  Saul\rf{RoSa00}, which involves solving a minimization problem for the
  global coordinates and should be computationally tractable if a truly
  low-dimensional embedding exists.

\item[2011-03-05 Predrag]
  We cannot tessellate with \po s; we can only work with \emph{periodic
    points}, hence we need to understand what Floquet vectors (AKA `covariant
  Lyapunov' vectors evaluated on \po s) tell us about the `physical
  dimension' of the local {\PoincSec}.

\item[2011-03-04 Evangelos]
  How could a trajectory be confined to a {\PoincSec}? You seem
  to talk about local charts in \refsect{sec:chart}, rather than {\PoincSec s}.

\item[2011-03-05 Predrag]
  Ant is not following a \emph{trajectory}, ant is moving \emph{transversely}
  to the time flow, for example: if the continuous time trajectory has one
  unstable eigen-direction, it sweeps out a 2-dimensional unstable manifold,
  whose {\PoincSec} is 1-dimensional curve that the ant could follow.

\item[2011-03-04 Evangelos]
  If we manage to use local {\PoincSec s} to reduce the flow to a
  discrete map (or maps) before applying this procedure, we would then only
  need one (or a few) representative point(s) per periodic orbit for our
  local charts, rather than points along the full orbit. However, we know
  this is tricky to do in a high-dimensional space, before an embedding is
  available.

\item[2011-03-05 Predrag]
  \HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_Quartet_No._16_(Beethoven)}
  {Es muss sein!} No sense can be made out of a collection of \po s unless
  they and their Floquet vectors are reduced onto  {\PoincSec s}.

\item[2011-03-04 Evangelos]
  In any case, while I can see many local {\PoincSec s} working
  together, either before or after the global coordinates are found, I
  cannot see how a tessellation as you describe it here would work.
  {\PoincSec s} are designed to pierce the flow (so the ant we follow
  would leave the section immediately) and good sections should be
  transverse, not tangent to the attractor.

\item[2011-03-05 Predrag] Grave misunderstanding. The continuous group
  that is being reduced by {\PoincSec s} is the evolution in time.
  After the reduction of continuous time to discrete time, what remains are
  the affine hyperplanes (local {\PoincSec s}) which are
  \emph{tangent} to the strange attractor; the ant is not crawling in the
  time direction, she is crawling (for example) along the unstable manifold
  heteroclinic section as it is seen within the {\PoincSec s}, not the
  time trajectory traced out in the full \statesp.

\item[2011-03-02 Evangelos] First meeting's wisdom:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[2011-03-02 Parisians] We
    \HREF{http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gargantua/Chapter_XVI}{Parisians}
    all agree that it's best to work on antisymmetric subspace KS.

  \item[2011-03-10 Predrag]
    \PCedit{
      I'm very worried about this development. We have settled in
      \refref{lanCvit07} on $L=22$ as the smallest system size for which the
      translationally invariant KS is empirically `shmurbulent.' We cannot work
      with \KS\ in the antisymmetric subspace at $L=22$, because there is no
      chaos there - that's why Lan and I worked\rf{lanCvit07} at  $L = 38.5$.
      We cannot work with \KS\ with the fixed $u(0)=u(L)=0$ boundary conditions
      at $L=22$, because there will be no shmurbulence there either - when the
      ends are pinned down, one needs a larger cell to approach the onset of
      shmurbulence, that's why the antisymmetric subspace required going up to
      $L = 38.5$. Besides, for small $L$ the boundary effects will dominate the
      dynamics, the \statesp\ geometry will be very different, and what we
      learn there will not scale to larger $L$. What was so elegant about
      analysis\rf{SCD07} of  $L=22$ system is that the geometry of the
      \statesp\ was so much more beautiful than what it is for the $L = 38.5$
      antisymmetric subspace. Since then we have lost fear of continuous
      symmetries\rf{SiCvi10,FrCv11}. And continuous symmetries are the
      physically interesting case. In summary, going to fixed b.c. is ugly,
      unphysical, and to add insult to injury, it would necessitate a whole new
      fishing expedition, abandoning all the wisdom we already have in the
      $L=22$ case.

\item[2011-03-02 Evangelos] First meeting's numerics:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Evangelos will do the shooting for periodic orbits
    (we need to decide on system size). He hopes he will find the time \ldots
  \item Kazz uses an implicit second order Adams(-Moulton) method (see post of
    2011-03-09), with pseudospectral space discretization.
    He uses some prescription for anti-aliasing, in order to keep the large wavenumbers
    and corresponding isolated Lyapunov vectors uncontaminated. Uses numerical
    recipes for FFT. (ES suggests switching to FFTW as numerical recipes FFT is
    known to be unreliable in double precision.)
  \item Evangelos uses explicit fourth order Runge-Kutta with exponential
    time differencing (see \refref{ks05com}) and pseudospectral space
    discretization. He uses brute force anti-aliasing (increases resolution
    to the point that only Lyapunov vectors already at round-off are affected by
    aliasing). He uses FFTW.
    \PC{can you identify this pesky reference 'ks05com'?}
  \item We agreed that a good strategy would be that Kazz implements a simple
    Newton routine, so that he can refine the orbits I give him. I've
    pointed him to Chaosbook chapters, my own first year report on Newton's
    method for periodic orbits and my thesis.
  \item I've also agreed to give Kazz the backbone of my integrator routines
    (and also pointed him to \refref{ks05com}). Kazz is suspicious towards
    Trefethen's algorithm, he thinks that the integrating factor trick might
    lead to under-resolved large wavenumbers and problematic isolated
    Lyapunov vectors (and that the implicit method performs better in this
    respect). I can't argue in favor of one or the other integrator.
  \item I am also thinking to try to implement anti-aliasing and see
    if agreement improves.
  \end{itemize}

\item[2011-03-09 Kazz] to Evangelos:
  Before your mail I made a code to improve the quality of the periodic orbits
  and it works very well. Now, with my integrator, the norm of distance
  (with square root) after one cycle is on the order of $10^{-13}$ for the orbit
  I focus on, and the trajectory stays nearby over $40$ periods, to be compared
  with $10$ for the original orbit data. I restarted all the calculations
  with this improved orbit.

  To answer your question, my code uses the splitting method with the
  2nd-order implicit method
  \HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_multistep_method}{(Adams-Moulton)}
  for the linear terms and the 2nd-order Runge-Kutta
  \HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heun\%27s_method}{(Heun method)}
  for the nonlinear term.

  For the aliasing, I use at least $(3N+1)$ spatial points when computing
  the nonlinear term, where $N$ is the wavenumber cutoff of the Fourier modes.
  Under this condition the pseudospectral method is exact
  (equivalent with the spectral method apart from the computational cost).

\item[2011-03-10 Kazz] To refine the orbits I use Newton's method,
  but I adapted it to apply to half a period, playing with the reflection
  symmetry. That is to say, instead of considering
  \[
    (I-J(u))(u'-u) - vt = -(u-f(u))\,
  \]
  I use
  \beq
  (R-J(u))(u'-u) - vt = -(Ru-f(u))\,
  \ee{eq:preper-newt} where $R$ is the operator
  for the reflection, i.e., $Ru(x) = -u(-x)$.
  It is better, not only because the integration time is half, but also because
  the reference coordinate $x_0$ for the reflection $u(x,t)=-u(x_0-x,t+T_p)$
  is automatically set to be 0.

  That said, I looked at the results from the refined orbit, and found
  that the results do not change. The angle between {\transient} Lyapunov vectors oscillates
  always with a finite amplitude.

\item[2011-03-10 ES] My bad here, I forgot to mention to Kazz that we
  use \refeq{eq:preper-newt} for pre-periodic orbits \ldots

\item[2011-03-10 Ruslan] {\em Comment on the numerical approximation of the KS flow}\\
  I would suggest not to worry too much about the accuracy of the numerical
  approximation of the KS flow.  Instead, it is better, in my opinion, to
  adopt the viewpoint that one investigates the properties not of the KS
  flow, but of the map defined by the numerical integrator of the \KSe,
  which approximates the solutions of the \KSe.  As long as the orbits of
  the map resemble the solutions of the flow (think of it in terms of
  shadowing), the results of our investigation of the map will faithfully
  represent those for the KS flow.  So, it doesn't matter whether one
  investigates the Kassam-Trefethen map or the Adam-Moulton-RK map: the
  qualitative picture will be the same.

  The neat thing about Kassam-Trefethen map is that it solves the linear
  part of the KS flow exactly, thus eliminating the problem of the
  stiffness of the linear part, and thus allowing to use a much larger time
  step.  Implicit Adams-Moulton also deals with the stiffness, but it
  solves the linear part only approximately, so it is likely to be less
  accurate if used with the same time step.

  From the same viewpoint, there is also no need, in my opinion, to use
  anti-aliasing.  If a better approximation of the KS flow is needed, just
  include more modes into the map and decrease the time step.  Of course,
  if Kazz already implemented anti-aliasing, then there is no harm in using
  it, provided it doesn't increase the flops count too much.

\item[2011-02-21 Kazz]
  If the isolated Lyapunov vectors of
  {unstable \po}s are strictly orthogonal, it means that the \jacobianM\ for a
  cycle can be decomposed to two parts, one of which would be an
  orthogonal submatrix. Does that seem likely to you?

\item[2011-03-10 Ruslan]
  I don't see why we should expect higher Lyapunov vectors to be {\em
    exactly} orthogonal.  Since all Lyapunov vectors in the \KSe\ are coupled
  though the nonlinear term, the deviation from orthogonality should be
  proportional to the strength of this coupling.  Of course this coupling
  is very weak for higher Lyapunov vectors and decreases exponentially with
  increasing mode number.  But if we measure with sufficient resolution,
  which is what Kazz does, we'll observe the deviation from orthogonality
  for any higher mode, whether anti-aliased or not.  Or am I wrong?

\item[2011-03-10 Predrag] My belief too. There is no reason to require
  \transient\ Floquet vectors to be pure, orthogonal Fourier modes: all we
  need is that perturbations along these directions are pushed back into
  the attractor without being entangled along it...

\item[2011-03-11 Ruslan] It seems to me that the behavior of the isolated
  Lyapunov vectors in the \KSe\ is rather easy to understand.  Since they
  are essentially generated by the linear part of the \KSe, they will be
  nothing else but the Fourier modes living in mutually orthogonal planes.
  That is, they are the eigenvectors of the \jacobianM\ of the trivial
  equilibrium $u = 0$, just slightly perturbed by the nonlinear coupling.
  But since, as I already said, this perturbation decays exponentially with
  the mode number, it is negligible for high enough modes.  So, to answer
  Kazz's question, the strongly contracting eigenvectors of the \jacobianM\
  of a cycle should be essentially orthogonal to one another as well as to
  the subspace spanned by the expanding and weakly contracting eigenvectors
  (i.e. the subspace where the {\entangled} Lyapunov vectors live).

\item[2011-06-28 Evangelos]
  Met with Kazz at \HREF{http://cct11.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/}{CCT11 conference}
  at Marseilles and discussed about their progress with Lyapunov vectors
  for periodic orbits. To my understanding, the main points are: Kazz
  \etal, identify generic orbits that come close to a periodic orbit. They
  use the vector defined by the points of minimal distance along these two
  trajectories as a local approximation to the ``inertial manifold.''
  However, some of the Lyapunov vectors computed along the periodic orbit
  and the generic trajectory are not identical or even similar (at the
  points of minimal distance). Kazz argues that it is not possible to
  define {\entangled} and isolated modes for periodic orbits (in his numerics
  the number of physical dimensions inferred from a periodic orbit would
  be, in general, different from the number of physical dimensions inferred
  from a generic orbit).

\item[2011-06-28 Predrag] I will deal with this in bits:
  First, not being in frequent contact is not working for me - I
  do not know what is being computed or why. Are we in the \KS\
  antisymmetric subspace at\rf{lanCvit07} $L = 38.5$, or the
  full space at $L=22$? As I wrote above in the {\bf 2011-03-10}
  entry, I believe we cannot work in the \KS\ antisymmetric
  subspace at $L=22$, as there is no shmurbulence there. If Kazz
  is integrating trajectories in the full space at $L=22$, he
  \emph{must} quotient the translational $\SOn{2}$, otherwise
  there is no way to define the (locally minimal) Euclidean
  distance(s) between a \po\ and a generic long-time trajectory\rf{FrCv11}.

\item[2011-07-22 Evangelos] Spatial shift in eq. (2) of 2011-07-21 draft seems
  to take care of that, although this approach seems to be somewhat inefficient.
  A question: Is the spatial shift a multiple of the spatial discretization step?
  If yes, then this means that you probably overestimate the distance of minimum
  approach based on eq. (2). You should then refine the comparison by introducing
  a local slice as in \refrefs{SiCvi10,FrCv11}.


\item[2011-06-28 Predrag]
  Using ``the vector defined by the points of minimal distance along these two
  trajectories as a local approximation to the inertial manifold'' makes no sense to me.
  The local approximation to the inertial manifold is spanned by the transverse
  \po\ Floquet eigenvectors at that periodic point (simplest to take a local {\PoincSec}
  normal to $\vel(\ssp)$ at $\ssp$).

\item[2011-06-28 Predrag]
  If the generic trajectory is close the periodic point in a direction
  along its unstable manifold, it is close. If it belongs to a different fold of the
  unstable manifold, than it is far away and can have quite different local
  tangent space.

  If the two points are close, the periodic point tangent space
  eigen-directions should be close to the {\cLvs} at the nearby generic
  point, as they are probing the same stable / unstable manifolds structure in the
  linear neighborhood that includes them both.

\item[2011-07-22 Evangelos]
  I've actually raised the objection about the generic trajectory belonging to a
  different fold of the unstable manifold of the periodic orbit to Kazz in our
  discussion at Marseilles. His
  counter-argument is, I think, based on figure 5(c) of 2011-07-21 draft. His
  claim is that since the angle tends to zero as the generic trajectory approaches
  the periodic orbit the approach has to be along the unstable manifold.
  However, I am not convinced that we can numerically tell the difference
  if the minimum distance along the local unstable
  eigen-direction is much larger than the separation of folds of the unstable
  manifold. Kazz, could you please clarify and give as more insight?

\item[2011-06-26 Kazz] It is not possible to
  define {\entangled} and isolated modes for periodic orbits (in my numerics
  the number of physical dimensions inferred from a periodic orbit would
  be, in general, different from the number of physical dimensions inferred
  from a generic orbit)

\item[2011-06-28 Predrag]
  A short \po\ might be quite hyperbolic, \ie\ never get close to any
  tangencies (small angles between leading Floquet eigenvectors). The longer ones
  should probe heteroclinic tangencies a bit better...

\item[2011-08-09 Predrag] For comments to Takeuchi and Chat\'e\rf{TaCh11}
  \emph{Can the inertial manifold be captured by unstable periodic
    orbits?}, see {\bf [2011-07-21]} entry, \refsect{sec:TaCh11}.

\item[2011-08-17 Evangelos]
  I've just arrived to Dresden and found out that Hugues will
  spend a year in the Institute heading a study group and Kazz will come
  here for a workshop. So I'll get a chance to talk discuss with them.

\item[2011-08-17 Evangelos]
  Kazz works in full space but studies
  periodic orbits. You and me know that relative periodic orbits are the
  relevant objects that are expected to capture the dynamics in presence
  of translational symmetry, so why not try them instead?

\item[2011-08-17 Predrag]
  Here is my proposal to you and Ruslan. You have some 40,000 \rpo s. Why
  not take a point on the Kazz favorite cycle
  \PO{10.25} as the template $\slicep$, and pick from
  the 40,000 \rpo s the set of the closest ones to it in its slice. As they
  are cycles in {\pSRed} you need to also make a local {\PoincSec}
  through template point $\slicep$ (within the slice), normal to the
  velocity vector $\velRed(\slicep)$, to find the closest passage. Some are
  probably as close as the Kazz chaotic trajectory closest passage. For
  each of the close ones you have the 9-12 leading eigenvectors, their
  orientations information on where you are on stable/unstable manifolds,
  and their relative separation vectors. Those Kazz will need to check,
  show they are in the `physical' 9 dimensions.

\item[2011-08-25 Hugues, Predrag]
  Evangelos is here sitting with me, and we tried to figure out what you
  meant exactly. We have a proposal for something (hopefully) close to your
  idea:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Take Kazz `favorite orbit' \PO{10.25} (or a few of them). For
    this one, we know the vectors pretty well, all along the cycle.
    {\bf [2011-08-25 Predrag]} Pick a \emph{specific point}
    $\ssp_{\PO{10.25}}$ on the Kazz favorite cycle \PO{10.25} as the
    \template\ $\slicep = \ssp_{\PO{10.25}}$. As you will use $\slicep$
    to fix both the slice and the {\PoincSec}, some choices might
    be better than others: I am not sure how to pick this starting point.
    The local {\PoincSec} through template point $\slicep$ (within
    the slice) is picked normal to the velocity vector
    $\velRed(\slicep)$. The Floquet vectors are computed \emph{within}
    both the slice and the {\PoincSec}; the computation is
    described in the ChaosBook Section 5.3
    \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/invariants.pdf} {Stability of
      \Poincare map cycles}.


  \item Take the 40000 or so \po s available; for each near one,
    determine the closest point to the \template\ point \PO{10.25} (by
    "slicing" or more pedestrian methods).
    {\bf [2011-08-25 Predrag]} Slicing + Poincar\'e is, \emph{by
      definition}, the closest distance between the \emph{\template\
      point} $\ssp_{\PO{10.25}}$ and the \po\ (or \rpo) $p$. There are
    \emph{no} more pedestrian methods that work. If they exist, please
    enlighten me; what Kazz does is unecessarily laborious and
    inaccurate. Nothing can be said about the topology of inertial
    manifold unless symmetry reduction is implemented first. We have
    implemented slicing on 3D Navier-Stokes full resolution pipe flow
    ($10^5$ dimensions), so what do you fear about slicing $10^2$
    dimensions but the fear itself?


  \item At this closest point $\ssp_p$ on {\po} $p$, we have a minimal
    distance $\|u_p\|$ to the \emph{\template\ point} $\ssp_{\PO{10.25}}$,
    and the corresponding difference vector $u_p$. We can then compute the
    angle between vector $u$ and the subspace spanned by the $n$~first
    Floquet vectors of the \template\ point  \PO{10.25} (at the point of
    closest distance of course).

  \item Plot this angle (or its mean), as a function of $\|u\|$ for the
    nearest 10-100 out of the 40000 (relative) \po s. This could give the
    same result as our Fig.5c: if you take fewer vectors than the
    `physical' number, then the angle is bounded away from zero, but if you
    take the `right' number (or more), then the angle goes linearly to zero
    with $\|u\|$. Throw away `near' \po s which are near in Euclidean
    metric, but are isolated and off the local tangent space to the
    `{\entangled}' manifold.

  \item This set of periodic \emph{points} covers a linearized tile
    around the \template\ point \PO{10.25}. Now take one of them toward the
    edge of the tile as the new \template\ point, and repeat. If that one
    has a small physical dimension for a finite neighborhood, we have a
    chance of tiling the entire inertial manifold as in
    \reffig{fig:Tesselate}.
  \end{enumerate}
  If, indeed, similar behavior is observed from just looking at \po s, then
  the dimension of the ``physical manifold'' has been indeed calculated
  using strictly only \po s.....  ah ah!

\item[2011-08-17 Evangelos]
  By the way, do you understand how Kazz handles spatial shifts? After a
  long exchange of emails it seems that I don't.

\item[2011-08-17 Predrag]
  I believe he does it what was the standard way before the invention of
  slicing. Following ChaosBook:

  {\SOn{2} irreducible representations:}
  Expand a smooth periodic function $u(\gSpace + 2\pi) =
  u(\gSpace)$ as a Fourier series
  \beq
  u(\gSpace) = a_0 + \sum_{m=1}^\infty \left(
    a_m \cos m \gSpace + b_m \sin m \gSpace
  \right)
  \,.
  \ee{FourierExp}
  The matrix representation of the \SOn{2}\ action
  on the $m$th Fourier coefficient pair
  $(a_m,b_m)$ is
  \beq
  \LieEl^{(m)}(\gSpace') \,=\,  \left(\barr{cc}
    ~\cos m \gSpace'  & \sin m \gSpace' \\
    -\sin m \gSpace'  & \cos m \gSpace'
    \earr\right)
  \,,
  \ee{SO2irrepAlg-m}
  For each chaotic trajectory point he runs $\theta$ in some interval and
  finds the minimal distance to the periodic point (their paper says that).
  Though I am not sure that this is what he really does.

  Sorry, getting too late - need to go to bed.

\item[2011-09-12 Evangelos] Talked with Kazz, Hugues and Francesco (2011-09-12).
  The main points are:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item No one wants to discuss slice fixing details, so I did not insist.
  \item I explained [2011-06-28 Predrag] comment on the discrepancy of some of the
    Lyapunov vectors as computed on a chaotic trajectory and a periodic
    orbit in Fig 3 of \rf{TaCh11}. Francesco says a math paper shows
    continuity of Lyapunov vectors but he will check the assumptions
    (and will send me the reference).
  \item We agreed to follow Predrag's suggestion and check the
    role of non-hyper\-bolic periodic orbits. Kazz will try to identify
    regions in state space where hyper\-bolicity seems to
    be violated and will give me some guesses for periodic orbits.
  \end{itemize}

\item[2011-09-12 Predrag] This aversion to slicing is a pain. None of the
  problems with continuous symmetries can be done without it, but so far I
  have only gotten Willis converted\rf{ACHKW11}
  \HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/ACHKW11.pdf}
  {(a rough draft is here)}, and that is because in pipes the streamwise
  continuous symmetry is $\SOn{2}$ (no discrete reflections) so
  \emph{nothing} can be done without slicing. Not slicing in KS, CLGe, and
  \pCf\ is simply wrong - one cannot organize the \statesp\ without it. My
  impression from the {\bf [2011-07-27 Kazz 2 Evangelos]} comments in
  \refsect{sec:TaCh11} is that Kazz is confused about what slicing
  is, but believes he understands it. Can you get EVO running in an MPI-KS
  conference room? Maybe I can get them to listen, through a webinar on
  slicing.

\item[2011-09-12 Predrag] It probably suffices that Kazz identifies 	
  regions in state space where hyper\-bolicity seems to 	be violated. Once
  you have it, you can get a guess from a long time recurrence plot for the
  nearest periodic orbits.

\item[2011-09-12 Predrag] I do not like that in their way of thinking,
  physical dimension is a consequence of non-hyperbolicity. Strange
  attractors are not structurally stable, and minute changes in dynamics
  totally change long-time non-hyperbolicities - infinitely many long \po s
  are born and destroyed for every system parameter change; does that mean
  that physical dimension changes? I guess it does, because if a stable
  orbit is created, their physical dimension goes to zero or one within
  that basin of attraction...

\item[2011-09-12 Evangelos 2 Predrag] Here non-hyperbolic periodic orbit follows
  the convention of ChaosBook.org, right? It seems that Kazz and Hugues follow a
  different convention. I will have to talk with Hugues.

\item[2011-09-12 Predrag]                           \toCB
  A precise definition would be a \po\ or \rpo\ with an exact (dynamical,
  not symmetry induced) marginal eigenvalue, $\eigExp[j] = 0$, as in
  ChaosBook Chapter ``Intermittency''. But in this context we are looking
  for (relative, I hope the light will go on for Kazz at some point) \po s
  with one or several positive Floquet exponents whose value is much below
  the Lyapunov exponents values. I expect it could be any of the '{\entangled}'
  eigen-directions exponents, meaning that different directions get
  entangled pairwise, at different regions of the \statesp.

\item[2011-08-25 Predrag]
  Until we do some {\PoincSec s} and have a symbolic dynamics
  labeling, let's call \PO{10.25} the \po\ with
  $\period{p}=10.25336729174627$, by specifying the period to 4 significant
  digits, and \RPO{16.3?} for \rpo\ with
  $(\period{p},\shift_p)=(16.3,2.86)$ - here I do not have the numbers
  handy, sorry. In principle we need both the period and the shift
  $(\period{p},\shift_p)=(.,.)$ to refer to a \rpo, but let's hope for
  purposes at hand time is enough to distinguish any two \rpo s explicitly
  cited.

\item[2011-10-26 Evangelos]
  I've looked at the minimum angles of pairs of leading Floquet vectors
  across all periodic orbits (not relative periodic) in Ruslan's data. I
  could reliably get the first five Floquet vectors for about $10,000$
  orbits with periods $T\in[10.25, 210.61]$ out of approximately $30,000$
  orbits in the set. Results are shown in \reffig{fig:ks22ppo_min_angle}.
  Largest (minimum) angle detected was $0.3155\pi$, smallest one was
  $3\times10^{-7}\pi$.

\item[2011-10-26 Predrag] \refFig{fig:ks22ppo_min_angle} is really
  interesting. Plotting the angle {\em vs} the leading Floquet exponent $\eigRe[1]_p$
  rather than time \period{p} is probably more informative.


  The \po s are not really \po s (there are none in the
  antisymmetric subspace for $L=22$, right?), but these pre-periodic
  things that drift in the group tangent direction and then return? [{\bf ES}: yes]
  You are using right (expanding forward in time) Floquet eigenvectors
  $\jEigvec[i]$? [{\bf ES}: yes] Maybe for contracting directions one has to switch to the
  left Floquet eigenvectors $\jEigvecT[i]$. Hugues will know.
  [{\bf ES 2011-10-27}: Just to be clear about what I do compute: I use the Jacobian
  calculated over a complete period ($2T_p$) to compute Floquet eigenvectors.
  Any objection? {\bf PC 2011-10-27}: dunno...]

  You are right to ignore the marginal directions, but it might be that
  when you do it correctly (\Poincare\ in time direction, \slice\ in \SOn{2}
  direction) you will get much larger angles, as $\jEigvec[i]$ might form
  very non-normal narrow pencils of eigenvectors, stretched out along the
  flow direction.

  I only have H\'enon intuition, not sure how it will play out for higher
  dimensions. If my hunch is right, I think for starters you should select
  only the \po s for which the leading pair $\jEigvec[1] \cdot \jEigvec[2]$
  has a small smallest angle, and then plot the point on the cycle where
  the angle is smallest, projected on $3D$ a physical coordinate
  frame\rf{GHCW07,SCD07} (no Fourier mode projections, please). It really
  should be plotted in a \Poincare\ in time direction, \slice in \SOn{2}
  direction, but we have not gotten that far. Note also that this $\cdot$
  product has no invariant meaning, the eigenframe is not orthogonal.

  If we are lucky these points
  will align, telling us where the primary folds (in the sense of H\'enon
  pruning front theory, \refchap{c-Henon}). But probably that will happen
  only in a {\PoincSec}, in the full flow the folds in unstable
  manifold have an extra, longitudinal dimension, which makes them a hell
  to visualize. Ditto the \SOn{2} tangent AKA drift direction.

  Once we see where these folds are in the \statesp\ we'll think of less
  painful ways of nailing them down then by the close \po\ passages.

  Small angles in $\jEigvec[2] \cdot \jEigvec[3]$, \etc, have to do with
  `non-leading' folds in the less expanding unstable manifold directions,
  so they will be trickier to visualize. Guys who generalize baker maps to
  volumes call that 'hyperchaos'. I have not been able to visualize these
  higher-dimensional folds. Again, just my pruning front hunch, might play
  out differently when there are 8 physical dimensions.

\item[2011-10-26 Predrag] Note that the leading Lyapunov exponent is
  $\Lyap = 0.048$ (see {\bf [2009-09-13 Ruslan]} above), and all
  $\eigRe[1]_p \geq 0.024$ in \reffig{fig:ks22ppo_min_angle}\,(b), so there
  could be a square-root non-hyperbolicity, indicated by families of cycles
  $\eigRe[1]_p \to \Lyap/2$, as in Fig 2  of \refref{AACII}, click
  \HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/AAC-II.pdf}{here}.

\item[2011-11-01 Evangelos] Hugues was in Chemnitz, talked with Yang and Radons.
  Yang claims he can determine the dimension of the ``inertial manifold'' for
  KSe $L=38.5$ in antisymmetric subspace (as in Lan and Cvitanovi\'c\rf{lanCvit07})
  simply by counting the number and dimensions of hetero- and homoclinic connections of
  equilibria in the system. However, he failed to explain to Hugues how he does it.

\item[2011-11-01 Evangelos and Hugues 2 Predrag] We think this might not be a totally
  crazy idea, but we are unsure whether it could be applied to larger systems (or in the
  full space).

  If we assume dynamics live on a finite dimensional space of (unknown)
  dimension $D$, then a robust connection will occur if the dimension
  $d_u^{(1)}$ of the unstable manifold of the ``donor'' \EQV{1} and the
  dimension $d_s^{(2)}$ of the stable manifold of the ``receiver''  \EQV{2}
  obey $d_u^{(1)}+d_s^{(2)} \geq D+1$ (this is just the condition for
  transversal intersection of $d_u^{(1)}$- and $d_s^{(2)}$-dimensional
  manifolds in $D$-dimensional space). % Since $d_s^{(2)}=D-d_u^{(2)}$ %
  (where $d_u^{(2)}$ the dimension of the stable manifold of the receiver)
  we get $d_u^{(1)}-d_u^{(2)}\geq1$. We know $d_u^{(1)}$ and % we can
  estimate $d_s^{(2)}=\sum_i d_u^{(i)}$ where $i$ runs over all known %
  ``donors'' from which a connection to \EQV{2} exists? we need an estimate
  for  $d_s^{(2)}$ in order to bound D from above. Presumably this is what
  Yang computes by taking into account the dimensions of all incoming
  unstable manifolds into \EQV{2}, but we do not know any details.

\item[2011-11-03 Predrag] I always have to think this argument through -
  not quite sure it is right. Maybe this helps -
  clippings from \refref{GHCV08}: ``
  Our computations rely on the simple principle that an object of dimension
  $k$ is likely to intersect in a stable way an object whose codimension in
  {\statesp} is less than or equal to $k$. At the bottom, this is nothing
  more than the fact that two submanifolds in general position can
  intersect if the sum of their dimensions is greater than or equal to the
  dimension of the {\statesp} (whether they actually intersect is a subtle
  question that is central to the ``structural stability'' of chaotic
  dynamical systems\rf{smale}). For an illustration in the nonlinear
  setting, see \refref{AbSh92}. Kevrekidis \etal\rf{KNSks90} (see Section 5
  of their paper) make elegant use of this principle and of invariant
  subspaces implied by discrete symmetries of the underlying PDE to
  numerically deduce the existence of a heteroclinic connection in the
  Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Indeed, they comment that their work may
  have implications for shear flows. With regard to the heteroclinic
  connections presented here, it is significant to note from Table~1 that
  the codimension of the stable manifold in the $S$-invariant space (which
  is equal to $d(W^u_S)$) of $\tLB$ is less than the value of $d(W^u_S)$
  for $\EQV{i}$ with $i=3,4,5$. Thus it is not surprising that the unstable
  manifolds of $\EQV{i}$ with $i=3,4,5$ intersect the stable manifold of
  {$\tLB$} in a stable way (\ie, robustly with respect to small changes of
  system parameters).
  ''

  Are you guys saying ``two submanifolds can intersect if the sum of their
  dimensions is greater than or equal to the dimension of the {\statesp}'',
  \ie,
  \beq
  d(W^u_{(1)})+d(W^s_{(2)}) \geq d\,,\quad \mbox{or }
  d(W^u_{(1)}) \geq d-d(W^s_{(2)})
  \,?
  \ee{hecsRobust}
  That argument does not require invoking the 'physical' dimension $D$, all
  unphysical dimensions are subtracted equally from $ d$ and $d(W^s_{(2)})$.

\item[2008-04-10 Predrag]
  This received wisdom that heteroclinic connections are due to
  continuous symmetries is nonsense. You have a heteroclinic connection
  in Lorentz, right? They can be robust if dimension of unstable
  manifold A + codimension of the stable manifold B add to or exceed
  the dimension of the \statesp, as explained in \refref{GHCV08}.

\item[2011-11-03 Predrag] By the way, it is not obvious to me that each local
  chart of a good atlas of the inertial manifold has the same physical dimension?
  Maybe there is some transitivity argument that it has to be so for all
  charts belonging to the same ergodic set. I do not know.

\item[2011-11-01 Evangelos and Hugues]
  We would also consider natural to take into account hetero- and
  homoclinic connections of (relative) periodic orbits, eventually building
  a network of interconnected invariant objects. Could we tell the
  dimension of the ``inertial manifold'' simply by counting vertices in
  this network? It would be natural to weight nodes in this network by
  their relative importance [as estimated by either their stability or by
  the number of times they are found in Ruslan's random search (these are
  known)], so that we preferentially examine connections of the most
  important nodes.

  How does this sound?

\item[2011-11-01 Ruslan] I suggest to weigh by stability, rather than
  the number of times found, since, even though the two are correlated, the
  latter also reflects the properties of the search algorithm, which you
  don't need in your analysis.

\item[2011-11-04 Predrag] I fully agree with Ruslan - I do not know of
  any argument that would identify a basin of attraction of the search
  method (small for Newton, large for variational methods described in
  ChaosBook.org ``Relaxation for cyclists'') with the natural measure of
  the same, given by its `geometrical' cycle stability and period weight.
  In our \pCf\ papers Gibson has used the frequency of how often a cycle
  shows up in searches that take initial point as a coarse measure of its
  weight, but that is because we have nothing better - we have no
  systematic symbolic dynamics and no systematic way of uniformly
  populating the strange attractor with cycle points in that case.

\item[2011-11-01 Evangelos and Hugues 2 Ruslan] We thought that if the
  trajectory Ruslan used to fish for relative periodic orbits is still
  available, and if the association of each located orbit to the point on
  the trajectory used as an initial guess is still known, we might have a
  quick and dirty way to figure out which connections of relative periodic
  orbits might be present and preferentially visited (follow how the
  chaotic trajectory hops from the neighborhood of one orbit to another).
  Are any data of this kind still available?

\item[2011-11-01 Ruslan] No, because I didn't use a single trajectory,
  but rather random initial conditions within a rectangular region of
  Fourier space containing the attractor, as described on p. 30 of
  \refref{SCD07}. If you want to find such a network of RPOs/PPOs, then I would
  suggest to generate a 'typical' long chaotic orbit and run a 'proximity'
  search on it.  I have attempted it some time ago and briefly described
  the results in my Snowbird 2007 presentation (see
  siminos/rpo\_ks/davidchack/DS07.ppt slides 28-31).  I believe this is
  something similar to what Kazz is doing (in terms of minimizing the
  distance along time a phase).  By the way, the same proximity search can
  be carried out among the RPOs/PPOs themselves. I'm sure this will allow
  us to organize them into 'happy families'.

\item[2011-11-02 Evangelos] A ``proximity'' search among RPOs/PPOs is
  what I am running right now with the goal of simply finding orbits close
  to the shortest periodic orbit. However, organizing the orbits into
  families this way really seems possible now. Stay tuned...

\item[2011-11-04 Ruslan] Just to point out that there is a caveat when
  looking at the proximity between RPOs/PPOs.  The proximity of a chaotic
  orbit to RPOs/PPOs gives the true picture of the influence of the latter
  on the orbit. But proximity between RPOs/PPOs (in the way we define it)
  is only an approximation to such influence, because it might happen that
  the phases of the two nearby RPOs/PPOs are not linked dynamically (i.e.
  they are not on the same slice).  But I suspect that RPOs/PPOs in very
  close proximity will have phases from nearby slices, hence I call it an
  'approximation'.

\item[2011-11-02 Evangelos] Asked by Hugues to plot the average minimum
  angle over some bins in $T_p$ in \reffig{fig:ks22ppo_min_angle}(a). I
  think it shows a tendency towards smaller angles for larger periods, but
  I wouldn't be able to say for sure whether it saturates towards some
  finite value or tends to zero. However, given the fact that we sample
  over a finite set of points along each orbit, so a tendency of the
  minimum angle towards a finite value should be expected.

\item[2011-11-04  Hong-Liu Yang]
  
  How is your reading of our preprint? Comments and suggestions are indeed welcome.

  Now I come back to your question posed at Paris that giving the \po s, as
  many as one wants, could one get the dimension of inertial manifold (IM)
  from those \po s?

  I got an idea to address this issue and think the answer should be yes.
  For the case of 1D KSe with L=22, one can already get the IM dimension 9
  from the information provided in your SIAM 2010 paper.

  It is known that \po s have different numbers of unstable directions,
  normally less than the IM dimension. From our previous {\cLv} analysis of
  IMs, we know that some stable directions should also take part in the
  dynamics on IMs. For \po s the number of stable directions are infinite,
  then the essential point is which stable directions should be included.
  The decision can not be made from the local stability information of \po
  s, like the Floquet exponents or vectors as you know already. We do need
  some global information, the heteroclinic connections. Heteroclinic
  connections go from the unstable directions of one \po  to the stable
  directions of another \po. A network can thus be formed with \po s as the
  nodes and heteroclinic connections as the links. Each node has both
  outcoming links (unstable directions) and incoming links (stable
  directions). For a given \po  the stable directions (incoming links) are
  historically unstable as the trajectory is close to the \po  at the other
  end of the heteroclinic connections. These stable directions should thus
  take part in the IM dynamics. Then one can simply count the number of
  total links of a give node to get the local estimate of the IM dimension.
  For a complete network, the ideal case, one can get the IM dimension from
  any representative nodes/\po s. Since the number of \po s is infinite, in
  general we can only start from "important" \po s to form a partial
  network and get the maximal value of the node-wise estimates. As we
  increase the number of nodes gradually the maximal estimate is expected
  to saturate to the (unknown) IM dimension when the network becomes
  sufficiently representative.

  Actually I would say the proposed network picture of chaos is the general
  organization rule of \po s for systems with or without IM.

  We should also say that this is not the only way of the organization of
  stable and unstable directions in a chaotic attractor, see for instance
  the Smale horseshoe picture. Possibly, hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic
  system have the different ways of organization.

  One possible concern could be the genericity of the occurrence of
  heteroclinic connections. My guess is that \po s are inter-connected as
  they are created via bifurcations. These inter-connections persist even
  when the system is away from the bifurcations. The existing connection
  can also be changed or destroyed when a new bifurcation occurs.

  Another issue, raised by Guenter, will be whether a partial network
  formed by only the equilibria can already give us the correct IM
  dimension, like the case of KSe with $L=22$. If so, the task can be greatly
  simplified.

\item[2011-11-07 Kazz] Can I have your raw data for \reffig{fig:ks22ppo_min_angle}.
  Comparing the orbits in the figure and those I studied in the PRL-style draft,
  Hugues and I agreed that the orbits we studied are actually not so typical;
  their period is too short and they are among the most hyperbolic ones.
  We should therefore look also at more typical orbits.
  For this purpose, I'd like to have your list of orbits with their period,
  degree of hyperbolicity, and the value of the first Floquet multiplier, i.e.,
  the raw data for \reffig{fig:ks22ppo_min_angle}.

  I'm also curious how things go on your side, in the attempt to measure
  the relation between the difference vector and the physical subspace
  for the collection of orbits.

\item[2011-11-07 Evangelos] Apart from the reasons you mention above,
  I also think you should look at other periodic orbits because I've
  had difficulties identifying relatively short periodic orbits that visit
  the neighborhood of \PO{10.25}.

  I've been looking at close encounters of periodic (and relative periodic) orbits
  in order to study the angle of the difference vector and the subspace spanned
  by the $n$ first Floquet eigenvectors.

  Some interesting examples are given in \reffig{fig:ks22shad} (see caption).
  In particular \PO{32.36} appears to shadow quite a few longer orbits.

  In order to find such close encounters efficiently I first tried some
  rudimentary slicing but encountered problems with jumps as described
  elsewhere\rf{SiCvi10,FrCv11}. So I've settled with using $\On{2}$-invariant
  variables similar in spirit to the ones in my thesis\rf{SiminosThesis}
  but given in a compact form without the use of computer algebra. I've noted
  down the expressions in siminos/ksReduced, in case you would like to know what
  is plotted in \reffig{fig:ks22shad}. I also suggest using these transformations
  when looking for close encounters of chaotic trajectories with periodic orbits.

  I now intent to turn to the actual computation of the angle of the difference
  vector and the subspace spanned by the $n$ first Floquet eigenvectors. However,
  I think I cannot get more than 6 (including marginal) eigenvectors accurately
  enough to draw safe conclusions. If I am correct, then the only option would be
  to send to Kazz some initial conditions for periodic orbits which come close
  to a reference orbit, so that he can get the vectors with better accuracy.

  Kazz, I'd also like to send you initial condition for \PO{38.66} anyway, to
  see if you can verify the angle between Floquet eigenvectors being small.

\item[2011-11-9 Evangelos] Note updated \reffig{fig:ks22shad} and \reftab{tab:ks22shad}.

\item[2011-11-9 Evangelos] There seems to be an unstable manifold variability argument
  emerging from \reffig{fig:ks22shad} and \reftab{tab:ks22shad}. Periodic orbits
  \PO{32.36} and \PO{40.35} are hyperbolic with unstable manifolds of dimension $1$ and $2$
  respectively. They appear to shadow \PO{102.4} which has a $2-$dimensional unstable manifold
  and small minimum angle of the two unstable eigenvectors, \ie\ it would appear
  to be non-hyperbolic. In the same manner, \RPO{34.64} and \RPO{39.77} with unstable manifolds
  of dimension $1$ and $2$, respectively, shadow \PO{70.35}, which has $2$-dimensional
  unstable manifold and is non-hyperbolic (I haven't computed minimum angle of eigenvectors
  for \rpo s yet).

  Note that \PO{38.66}(not plotted) shadows \RPO{34.64}. It would be interesting to look
  at this from a (dynamical) symmetry breaking bifurcation perspective.

\item[2011-11-9 Evangelos]  In all cases shown here,
  the periods of the shorter cycles (multiplied by the number of times a cycle is revisited)
  (approximately) add up to the period of the longer cycle shadowed by the short ones.
  I don't know whether we should read too much into \rpo\ shifts adding up to zero (or $L/2$)
  when two \rpo s shadow a \po.

\item[2011-11-07 Hugues] The data of \reffig{fig:ks22shad} would be nice,
  but what we would need also are the full coordinates of some selected orbits with:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item not-so-large period
  \item very small minimum angle
  \item preferably first Floquet exponent near the first stability exponent
  \end{itemize}

  From \reffig{fig:ks22shad}, we can see that there are certainly some like
  that with a period near 80, and probably some not so bad with period around 40...


\item[2011-11-9 Evangelos] I think the two longer orbits in
  \reftab{tab:ks22shad} are good candidates (although Floquet exponent is
  not very close to the first Lyapunov exponent) for Kazz to repeat the
  calculations in his draft. I will study them in more detail anyway, to
  see where the angle of eigenvectors becomes minimal, \etc.

\item[2011-11-15 Evangelos] Updated \reffig{fig:ks22shad}. For each of
  the numerically computed points along each of the shorter cycles we plot
  the minimum distance from any of the numerically computed points along
  the longer cycle to which they come close. We also plot the angle
  $\theta_{1,2}$ of the unstable Floquet eigenvectors along the points of
  the longer cycle. For both cases shown in \reffig{fig:ks22shad}, we
  observe that (local) minima of $\theta_{1,2}$ are associated with passage
  from the neighborhood of one of the shorter cycles to the neighborhood of
  the other. For instance, in \reffig{fig:ks22shad}(d) we can see that
  points on \PO{70.45} which are close to \RPO{34.64} are separated by
  points close to \RPO{39.77} by the global minimum of $\theta_{1,2}$ at
  $t\simeq37$, while a local minimum at $t\simeq70$ is associated to
  passage from the neighborhood of \RPO{39.77} to that of \RPO{34.64}.

\item[2011-11-15 Predrag] (a very minor suggestion) - I guess your angle
  is always positive, so why not plot $(t,\ln \theta_{1,2}(t))$ - it will
  emphasize the close passages, which is what you care about.
  {\bf 2011-11-16 Evangelos} Both distances and angles are already plotted
  in logarithmic scale to emphasize close passages.
  {\bf 2011-11-16 Predrag}
  Sorry, I see that the right edge of \reffig{fig:ks22shad}\,(c) is logarithmic
  but I guess I do not understand the left edge - shouldn't 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001
  be equally spaced? {\bf 2012-05-21 Evangelos} Sorry, it is fixed now.
  (It ways very quirky to do it correctly. It seems matlab refuses to
  plot both axes in log scale in a straitforward manner,
  or it's just that I've learned it after 30.)

\item[2012-02-06 Evangelos] Talked with Hugues at MPIPKS, created a to-do list:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Compute ``IM'' dimension from periodic orbits only:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Compute difference vector of points of closest approach of two
      nearby periodic orbits. Compute Floquet vectors of periodic
      orbits. Proceed as in Takeuchi and Chat\'e draft to infer
      dimension of ``IM''.
    \item
      Find bits of trajectory shadowing two short periodic orbits (and
      possibly a third longer one which shadows the two short orbits),
      compute dimension of ``IM'' as in Takeuchi and Chat'e draft.
      Compare with dimension we get from periodic orbits alone.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Tangencies of trajectory and proximity of ``non-hyperbolic'' \po s.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Choose a collection of typical periodic orbits (\ie\ with leading
      Floquet exponent close to the leading stability exponent of the flow)
      with small minimum angle of Floquet eigenvectors. Calculate
      systematically distance of chaotic trajectory to all of these.
    \item
      Is there a correlation between tangencies and proximity to one of
      these \po s?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\item[2012-02-14 PC]                        \toCB
  As almost no \po s are stable, I call unstable \po s simply '\po s,' and
  the stable ones 'limit cycles'. `UPOs' is a Maryland abomination,
  aesthetically. But we have a more important nomenclature decision to
  make: for dynamical systems with $\SOn{n}$ symmetry there are generically
  no \po s, only \rpo s. In presence of discrete symmetries there are \po s
  in the invariant subspaces fixed by discrete symmetry subgroups, but they
  have no relation to the chaotic / turbulent dynamics (compare
  Christiansen\rf{Christiansen97} with Cvitanovi{\'c}, Davidchack, and
  Siminos\rf{SCD07}). In the above you keep talking about \po s, but the
  chaotic dynamics is supported by \rpo s and pre-periodic \rpo s, 50-50\%,
  no \po s at all. From \refref{SCD07}:

  ``Due to invariance under reflections, KS equation can also have
  \rpo s {\em with reflection}, which are
  characterized by a profile $u_p(x)$ and
  period $\period{p}$
  \beq
  \Refl u(x+\shift,\period{p}) =
  -u(-x-\shift,\period{p}) = u(x+\shift,0) = u_p(x)
  \,,
  \label{KSpos}
  \eeq
  giving the family of equivalent solutions
  parameterized by $\shift$
  (as the choice of the reflection point is arbitrary,
  the shift can take any value in $-L/2 < \shift \leq L/2$).

  Case {\bf (b)}: The \po\ satisfies
  \beq
  u(x,t+\period{p})=\gamma u(x,t)\,,
  \label{eq:POspattemp}
  \eeq
  for some group element $\gamma\in \On{2}$ such that $\gamma^m=e$ for some
  integer $m$ so that the orbit repeats after time $m \period{p}$ (see
  \refref{golubitsky2002sp} for a general discussion of conditions on the
  symmetry of \po s). If an orbit is of reflection type \refeq{KSpos},
  $\Refl\Shift_{\shift/L} u(x,\period{p}) = -u(-x-\shift,\period{p}) =
  u(x,0)$, then it is pre-periodic to a \po\ with period $2\period{p}$.
  Indeed, since $(\Refl\Shift_{\shift/L})^2 = \Refl^2 = 1$, and the KS
  solutions are time translation invariant, it follows from \refeq{KSpos}
  that
  \[
    u(x,2\period{p}) = \Refl\Shift_{\shift/L} u(x,\period{p}) =
    (\Refl\Shift_{\shift/L})^2 u(x,0) = u(x,0)\;.
  \]
  Thus any shift acquired during time $0$ to $\period{p}$ is compensated by
  the opposite shift during evolution from $\period{p}$ to $2 \period{p}$.
  All periodic orbits we have found for $L=22$ are of type
  \refeq{eq:POspattemp} with $\gamma=R$. Pre-periodic orbits with
  $\gamma\in C_n$ have been found by Brown and Kevrekidis\rf{BrKevr96} for
  KS system sizes larger than ours, but we have not found any for $L=22$.
  ''

  In the rest of the paper we call \po s of type \refeq{eq:POspattemp} with
  $\gamma=R$ `pre-periodic.' We should give them their own name (or find
  one in the literature?), reserve `pre-periodic' for the $\gamma\in C_n$:
  those are truly periodic on the fundamental domain that is $1/n$ of the
  full \statesp, see ChaosBook.org chapter
  ``\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/paper.shtml\#discrete}{World in a mirror},''
  where \Rot{1/2} case is worked out in detail for the one-eared Van Gogh
  attractor.

\item[2011-12-06, 2012-02-14 PC]
  I tried out the word ``inertial manifold'' [IM] (invariant and exponentially
  attracting) on a few mathematicians, and they get very worked up - it is
  not defined, it has been shown that it cannot be defined in 3 dimensions
  (million dollar question) \etc. In particular, we have to work on
  convincing Constantin that this is new - he sees nothing new in the
  {\cLvs} approach, believes they did it all much earlier in their
  proof of the finite dimension of the KS ``global attractor'' (I believe
  that is what they call it, not ``inertial manifold''. It is a million
  dollar question. We should recheck the literature -
  \refref{constantin_integral_1989,Constantin97} and a number of other
  papers (read {\bf [2011-07-25 PC: Inertial manifold literature]} in
  \refchap{s:LyapunovVec}). He is smart and highly regarded in the
  mathematics community, so we definitely do not want to have him dismiss
  this work.

  Tentative suggestion: perhaps safer to say ``global attractor'' or
  ``{\nws}''. Though neither is what we have in mind (it has to be a
  connected, transitive attractor).

\item[2012-02-14 PC] I still do not know whether partially hyperbolic
  invariant tori (such as computed in \refref{LCC06}, provided they really exist)
  are more important than \rpo s in supporting shmurbulence on attractors whose
  physical dimension is of order 10-1000...

\item[2012-02-06 Evangelos]
  It also seems I will eventually need to implement the {\cLv}
  calculation algorithm of Ginelli \etal\rf{ginelli-2007-99}. I will
  ``officially'' have more time in March, but I am a
  \HREF{http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/}{structured
    procrastinator} so I might actually turn to this right now.
  {\bf [2012-02-14 PC]} Sara ordered me to read this months ago, but
  I'm procrastinating.

\item[2012-03-15 Kazz]
  Maybe I should add here some words in relation to Constantin's understanding.
  First, showing the finite dimensionality of the inertial manifold
  or the global attractor, which was indeed proved mathematically
  for systems like KS,
  is not the central point of our {\cLv} approach.
  Instead, we gave an \textit{exact} number for this dimension,
  albeit not rigorously, whereas the mathematicians could provide
  only its upper bound which does not look ``physical'' at all;
  for example, the best upper bound for the KS inertial manifold dimension
  so far is $\text{const.} \times L^{2.46}$, while we naturally expect it
  to be proportional to $L$ for the extensivity.
  I completely agree that we should try to convince him of this point,
  all the more because we need help of mathematicians like him to establish
  the bridge between our {\cLv} approach and the inertial manifold
  on firm grounds.

  Concerning the inertial manifold vs global attractor, as far as I
  understand, the former is a smooth invariant manifold of integer
  dimension that attracts outside trajectories exponentially, while the
  latter is a manifold of finite Hausdorff (thus noninteger) dimension in
  which trajectories are confined after infinitely long time.
  We believe that what we see by {\cLvs} is the former,
  because of the integer dimension and the exponential attraction.

\item[2012-03-15 Predrag] I agree, Constantin bounds ``the global
  attractor of the dissipative system.'' This is a fragile object, and
  can easily change non-smoothly as you vary things like $L$. If
  `inertial manifold' is what you say, we also need some statement that
  the integers they get are the best possible and agree with your (sharp)
  physical dimension.

  In my humble opinion Hausdorff and other `fractal' dimensions are
  useless, while your 'physical' integer dimension is the best thing since
  invention of Swiss cheese. Convergence of Fourier series for KS makes
  more physical sense to me. We have written this in \refref{SCD07}:

  ``
  In the Fourier basis the conservation of energy on average takes form
  \beq
  0 = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} ( q_k^2 - q_k^4 )\,
  \timeAver{E}_k
  \,,\qquad
  E_k(t) =  {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} |a_k(t)|^2
  \,.
  \ee{EFourier1}
  The large $k$ convergence of this series is insensitive to the system
  size $L$; $\timeAver{E_k}$ have to decrease much faster than $q_k^{-4}$.
  Deviation of $E_k$ from this bound for small $k$ determines the active
  modes. For \eqva\ the $L$-independent bound on $E$ is given by
  Michaelson\rf{Mks86}. The best current bound\rf{GiacoOtto05,bronski2005}
  on the long-time limit of $E$ as a function of the system size $L$ scales
  as $E \propto L^{2}$.
  ''

  Forever it is worth, here are my notes (June 2008) cribbed from
  Bronski\rf{bronski2005} and/or talking to people:

  ``
  Nicolaenko, Scheurer and Temam\rf{NSTks85} gave the first long-time
  boundedness result for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, showing that
  $\limsup_{t \rightarrow \infty} |\!|u|\!|_2 \le C L^{\frac{5}{2}}$ for
  odd initial data, as well as showing that bounds on the $L_2$ norm imply
  bounds on the dimension of the attractor.

  The $L_2$ estimate was improved by Collet, Eckmann, Epstein and
  Stubbe\rf{CEEksgl93} who  extended it to any mean-zero initial data and
  improved the exponent from $\frac{5}{2}$ to $\frac{8}{5}$, and by
  Goodman\rf{Good94}, who extended it to any mean-zero initial data with the
  same exponent.

  In these papers the function $|\!|u-\phi|\!|_2^2$ is a Lyapunov function
  for an appropriately chosen $\phi$ and $|\!|u|\!|_2$ sufficiently large.

  Bounds which do not fit into Lyapunov function framework:
  Ilyashenko\rf{Ilyash92}, Otto  and Giacomelli\rf{GiacoOtto05}. The
  latter, which treats the KS equation as a perturbation of the Burger's
  equation, is currently the best estimate, establishing that
  \[
    \limsup_{t \rightarrow \infty} |\!|u|\!|_2 = o(L^{\frac{3}{2}}).
  \]
  Bronski and Gambill\rf{bronski2005} give an argument of the Lyapunov
  function type which establishes the slightly weaker result
  \[
    \limsup_{t \rightarrow \infty} |\!|u|\!|_2 = O(L^{\frac{3}{2}}).
  \]
  Their proof applies equally to the destabilized \KSe
  \[
    u_t = -u_{xxxx} - u_{xx} + \gamma  u + u u_x
    ~~~~~~\gamma > 0 ~~~~~ \int u(x,0)dx = 0.
  \]
  It was shown by Wittenberg\rf{Witte02} that this equation
  has stationary solutions which satisfy $|\!|u|\!| \propto L^{\frac{3}{2}}.$
  Since a Lyapunov function argument for the KS equation also applies
  to the dKS equation (for sufficiently small $\gamma$) Wittenberg
  argued that $\frac{3}{2}$ is the best exponent that one can expect
  from the Lyapunov function approach.

  Similar ideas of greater generality have been used by Constantin and
  Doering\rf{CoDoe92,CoDoe95} to establish bounds on energy dissipation in
  fluids, and generally go by the name `background flow method.'

  % 
  {\bf PC}:
  % Past: Michael Loss has not taught us how to bound $E$ by
  % Sobolev bounds. Neither has Spiegel. Next: But
  Constantin says that the answer is in \refrefs{NSTks85}. Eckmann says:
  the  best bound is by Otto\rf{GiacoOtto05}; the only bound close to $k=0$,
  better in essential way. Eckmann had
  $L^{8/5}$, but conceptually Otto is the best. Recheck whether it is $|u|$
  or $E \propto L^{3/2}$. When the solution is big, how long can it stay
  big? They found it cannot stay big for long.

  Predrag: From bounds on energy, we might be able to bound the number of \eqva\ as
  function of systems size $L$, and thus be sure we have them all.

  Next for you guys: read Lieb and Ruelle to learn how to bound $E$  by
  Sobolev bounds.

  The basic strategy is to choose a periodic function $\phi_x$ of zero mean
  such that the following quadratic form is coercive,
  \[
    <\!\!u, K u\!\!>= \int u_{xx}^2 - u_x^2 + \phi_x u^2 \ge \delta |\!|u|\!|^2,
  \]
  for $u$ satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions and some positive
  $\delta$ independent of $L$.

  This calculation is, in a sense, complementary to Lieb-Thirring type
  inequalities. In Lieb-Thirring inequalities one attempts to maximize some
  measure of the negative part of the spectrum of an operator over all
  potentials with a fixed norm.
  ''

\item[2012-03-15 Kazz]
  The bounds given in terms of $\limsup_{t \rightarrow \infty} |\!|u|\!|_2$
  (or with any other norms) should be those for the global attractor.
  For the inertial manifold,
  Giacomelli and Otto \rf{GiacoOtto05} seem to have obtained a new bound,
  $o(L^{12/5})$, which is slightly better than the one I knew, $O(L^{2.46})$,
  by Robinson \rf{Robinson-PLA1994}.

\item[2017-02-17 Xiong]
  Some new paper on the estimation: \rf{Otto09, GoJoOt15}.
  

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    In 1985, Nicolaenko, Scheurer and Temam\rf{NSTks85} gave the first asymptotic 
    boundedness 
    of the $L^2$ norm of $u(x,t)$ in the asymmetric subspace,
    showing the existence of  an absorbing ball 
    $S = \{u\,:\, \norm{u}_{L^2} \le C L^{5/2}\}$
    for antisymmetric solutions. They also show that the Hausdorff dimension of the 
    global attractor is bounded above by $O(L^{13/8})$.
    This antisymmetric assumption was later removed by
    Goodman\rf{Good94} in 1994.
    The $L^2$ estimate was improved by P. Collet \etal\rf{CEEksgl93}
    who extended it to the whole state space and improved the 
    exponent from $5/2$ to $8/5$. Later on, When studying the inertial
    manifold of \KSe, M. S. Jolly \etal\rf{jolly_evaluating_2000} 
    reduce the constant coefficient by half.

    $L^2$ norm : $\norm{u}_{L^2} = (\int_{0}^L u^2 dx)^{1/2}$.
  \item
    In 2005, Giacomelli and Otto\rf{GiacoOtto05} gave 
    \[
      \limsup_{t\to\infty}|\!|u|\!|_2 = o(L^{\frac{3}{2}})
    \]
    which currently is the best estimate. Based on this result, they
    gave an upper bound of the dimension of the inertial manifold
    $\dim(\mathcal{M}) = o(L^{12/5})$.

    The big-O notation: 
    $f(x) = O(g(x))$ if and only if there exists a positive real number $M$ and 
    a real number $x_0$ such that $|f(x)| \le M |g(x)|$ for all $x \ge x_0$.
    
    The little-O notation :
    $f(x) = o(g(x))$ if and only if there exists a  
    a real number $x_0$ such that $|f(x)| \le M |g(x)|$ for all $x \ge x_0$ and 
    all positive real number $M$.

  \item  
    In 2006, Bronski and Gammbill\rf{bronski2005} gave a weaker estimate 
    \[
      \limsup_{t\to\infty}|\!|u|\!|_2 = O(L^{\frac{3}{2}})
    \]
    which is claimed to be 
    the best result one can get through the Lyapunov function approach. 
    
  \item 
    In 1988, Foias, Nicolaenko, Sell and Temam\rf{FNSTks88} gave an upper bound 
    $O(L^{7/2})$ for the dimension of the inertial manifold of \KSe.
  \item 
    Both \rf{FNSTks85} and \rf{jolly_evaluating_2000} gave the upper bound of the
    inertial manifold to be $O(L^{2.46})$.
    
  \item Otto\rf{Otto09} in 2009 proves that 
    \[
      \limsup_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T dt \norm{|\partial_x|^\alpha u}^2 
      = O(L\cdot\ln^{10/3} L)
      \,,\qquad 1/3 < \alpha \le 2 
      \,.
    \]
    The $L^2$ norm of the 
    time-averaged fractional derivatives of $u(x,t)$ is almost 
    proportional to $L^{1/2}$. Bronski and Gammbill\rf{bronski2005}
    also claim that $1/2$ is believed to be the best possible exponent.

\section{To do list}
\label{sect:ToDo}

\begin{description}
\item[2013-10-18 Kazumasa]
  This is a list of things to do, made by Kazz, Hugues, and Evangelos,
  and discussed in the webEX pow-pow (with \XD, Daniel, Ruslan
  and predrag, on October 15.
\end{description}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Comparison of Floquet (stability) exponents and {\cLvs} between trajectory and orbits.

  Our earlier observations showed that the Floquet (stability) exponents and {\cLvs}
  of a chaotic trajectory may not necessarily be similar to
  those of a nearby orbit.
  Part of these observations is presented in section~\ref{sec:KS-CompLyapVec}.
  First we should investigate it more systematically,
  using more approaching events, other periodic orbits
  (with varying periods, hyperbolicity,
  and/or the number of positive exponents, etc.),
  or triplets of orbits
  (two short orbits and a longer orbit shadowing them;
  see \refFig{fig:ks22shad}).
  The goal here is to understand in which conditions {\cLvs}
  of the chaotic trajectory are given by Floquet vectors of nearby orbits.


\item Determination of the physical dimension from information of periodic orbits.

  The {\entangled} modes refer to the {\cLvs}
  that have tangencies between them along the chaotic trajectory
  and are thereby distinguished from the rest of the {\cLvs},
  the {\transient} modes,
  which are hyperbolically decoupled from the {\entangled} modes.
  On the basis of numerical observations,
  we conjecture that the set of the {\entangled} modes (`{\entangled} manifold')
  constitutes a linear approximation of the inertial manifold, so that
  the inertial manifold dimension is given by the number of the {\entangled} modes,
  $N_{\rm ph}$ \cite{YaTaGiChRa08,TaGiCh11}.
  Now the question is whether this {\entangled} manifold and/or its dimension
  can be reconstructed from properties of periodic orbits.
  We are happiest if we can do so only from the properties of periodic orbits,
  but as a first attempt we are combining information
  from both chaotic trajectories and nearby periodic orbits.
  In our unpublished manuscript \cite{TaCh11}, we took the orbit \PO{10.25},
  denoted by $u_p(x,t)$,
  and focused on moments at which $u_p(x,t)$ is approached
  by a chaotic trajectory $u(x,t)$.
  We measured the angle between the difference vector, $u(x,t) - u_p(x,t)$
  \footnote{
    The difference {\cLv} is defined with respect to $u_p(x,t)$
    appropriately shifted in space and time;
    see descriptions below \refeq{eq:MetricDistance}.
  }, and the subspace spanned by the first $n$ {\cLvs}.
  Then we found that the angle tends to zero as the distance goes to zero,
  iff $n \geq N_{\rm ph}$, i.e., if the subspace contains
  all the {\entangled} modes.

  Now what we suggest is to construct the subspace
  by the first $n$ Floquet vectors of the orbit,
  instead of the {\cLvs} of the trajectory,
  and play the same game.
  Then, can we define the ``physical dimension'' for this orbit?
  (can we find similar threshold in $n$?)
  If yes, is it the same as the true physical dimension?
  Do different periodic orbits have different physical dimensions,
  and if yes, how they are related to the true physical dimension?
  Is it related to hyperbolicity? and so on.

\item Recurrence of chaotic trajectories.

  Although we don't use periodic orbits here, it is directly linked
  to the questions raised above...
  Yang and Radons \cite{YaRa11} reported a result very similar
  to the above-mentioned unpublished one \cite{TaCh11},
  except that they used recurrent points of a chaotic trajectory
  instead of a periodic orbit (measuring their ``projection error''
  is equivalent to measuring the angle, asymptotically).
  Here, they randomly picked up 200 reference points
  and accumulated $10^4$ recurrent points to each of them,
  but they didn't take into account hyperbolicity of the chosen points
  (in other words, hyperbolic, less hyperbolic, and almost non-hyperbolic points
  are mixed up).
  On the other hand, if the ``local'' physical dimension
  (as measured by periodic orbits) depends
  on the hyperbolicity of the corresponding point,
  we need to take it into account when choosing reference/recurrent points.
  What happens if one only uses almost non-hyperbolic points (as defined below)
  as reference/recurrent points?

\item Constructing network of the {\entangled} manifold.

  As stated above, the {\entangled} manifold is defined by the {\entangled} modes.
  Pairs of {\entangled} modes become tangent at some points along the trajectory.
  Therefore, we can construct network of {\entangled} modes
  by identifying such points of tangency
  and recording which {\entangled} modes become tangent at each point.
  We can categorize these non-hyperbolic points
  by the signs of the Floquet (stability) exponents of the tangent modes
  (2 positive, 1 positive and 1 negative, 1 neutral and 1 negative, etc.).
  How is it related to the hyperbolic properties of nearby orbits?

\item Other remarks.

  Since the system we're currently working on
  (KS equation, periodic boundary, $L=22$)
  has only one positive Floquet (stability) exponent and a nearly null exponent
  (the 5th exponent is -0.003, following the three null exponents
  (without symmetry reduction)), it may not be the optimal choice.
  We may try larger system sizes to have more than one positive exponents.
  It is also worthwhile to try the rigid boundary condition
  (such as $u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0$), with which we do not need to consider
  the symmetry reduction.
  Relative periodic orbits are also suppressed in this way.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{description}
\item[2013-12-16 Evangelos]
  Following todays WebEX conversation, I have a comment
  regarding item 2 in the above ``To do list''. I still think it might be worth trying
  to use only periodic orbits (no chaotic trajectory) to infer the dimension of
  the {\entangled} manifold. If I understand it correctly Kazumasa's objection is
  that one cannot produce enough points for good statistics
  from a single pair of orbits. How about using multiple pairs of orbits for this?
  What I suggest is the following: Identify multiple pairs of (relative)
  periodic orbits that approach each other (in some suitable metric),
  and record the minimum distance and angle between floquet subspace
  and difference vector for each pair. The minimum distance of approach is well
  defined for a pair of orbits, so we might be able to get acceptable statistics
  with relatively few points. What do you think?

\item[2013-12-18 Kazumasa]
  Here is my summary on the things to do (addressed to Xiong),
  based on the WebEX discussions on Monday.\\
  (1) Adapt the initial condition of each orbit to your code.
  You can use the current initial condition data
  as the first guess for the Newton method.
  I also did such an adaptation for my code and it works very well.
  Then you will not have a disconnection of cycles
  as in \reffig{fig:ppo9vectorfield123}.\\
  (2) With this improved initial condition,
  compute Floquet multipliers and eigenvectors for multiple points
  along a cycle (e.g., $\cycle{ppo1} = \PO{10.25}$).
  Compare these eigenvectors with the vectors evolved by the Jacobian matrix
  (i.e., the vectors used in \reffig{fig:ppo1rate}).
  By computing eigenvectors for multiple points,
  instead of evolving them by the Jacobian, you will not have a problem
  like in \reffig{fig:ppo1rate} right bottom panel.\\
  (3) Tackle the problem 2 in the to do list.
  Read through the manuscript \cite{TaCh11}
  (don't take seriously our previous conclusion
  that orbits cannot capture the physical dimension),
  try to make a plot like Fig.5(c)
  by using the subspace spanned by the first $n$ Floquet eigenvectors
  of the orbit,
  instead of the first $n$ Lyapunov vectors of the chaotic trajectory
  as in the manuscript.
  Report if you find the same physical dimension (=9) or not.\\
  (4) The orbit $\cycle{ppo1} = \PO{10.25}$ is strongly hyperbolic
  (i.e., angles between eigenvectors stay far from zero all the time).
  Take another orbit that is less hyperbolic
  (i.e., angles between some eigenvectors approach zero
  at some point along the orbit)
  and play the same game as (3).
  Do you find the same physical dimension?
  I think these are enough for now.

\item[2013-12-18 Kazumasa to Evangelos]
  I completely agree.
  What I wanted to tell on the WebEX discussions is that
  we cannot infer the physical dimension only from a ``single'' orbit,
  because then the distribution of angles
  measured along the finite-length orbit is necessarily bounded,
  for all pairs of Lyapunov modes.
  We don't have such a problem if we use multiple orbits instead,
  so what you suggest (this is also what we had discussed with Hugues, right?)
  is absolutely interesting and something that we have to try.

\section{Comparison of Floquet (stability) exponents
  and {\cLvs} between trajectories and \po s}
\label{sec:KS-CompLyapVec}

\begin{description}
\item[2013-10-18 Kazz and Hugues]
\end{description}


We have computed Lyapunov exponents (LEs)
and the Floquet (covariant / stability) exponents (CLVs)
in the KS equation with $L=22$,
for chaotic trajectories as well as for some \po s.
\PC{2013-10-18 You are in the invariant subspace, with \SOn{2}\
  eliminated by the antisymmetry around $x=0$, right?}
We had expected that, when a trajectory and a \po\ get close enough,
their sets of LEs $\lambda^{(i)}$ and CLVs $v^{(i)}$
become also practically the same
($i$ is the index of the Lyapunov mode).
Although this was roughly confirmed in \reffig{kaz4-VectCompar}
with the \po\ \PO{10.25} and at a particular approaching event,
later we found with other events and orbits that
only some {\cLvs} coincide between a trajectory and an \po,
while other modes do not.
This section aims at explaining this issue:
In which conditions do LEs and CLVs agree between a trajectory and an orbit?
What is the relation to the hyperbolicity of the orbits,
distance from the trajectory, etc?

We present here what we have found by now.
The orbits we use here are \PO{10.25}, \PO{33.38}, \PO{46.51},
and the triplets in \refFig{fig:ks22shad}(b,d)
(\RPO{34.64} and \RPO{39.77} shadowing \PO{70.35})
\footnote{
  This section is not yet finished.
  Although I have raw data for these orbits, I don't analyze them yet...
  So for the moment the section only shows results for \PO{10.25}.
}
% The values of their Floquet multipliers provided by Evangelos
% and the corresponding Lyapunov exponents
% are listed in \refTbl{tbl:ks22pofl}.
% The simulations were performed after adapting the orbits
% to the numerical scheme employed here
% (so that they form closed loops after a period).
% Because of the different choice of the scheme,
% the actual values of the period and the Lyapunov exponents
% are slightly different from those in \figTbl{tbl:ks22pofl}
% obtained by Evangelos.
Note that the orbits provided by Evangelos
were adapted to our numerical scheme
(so that they form closed loops after a period),
which slightly changed the period and the LEs
(hence the Floquet multipliers) of the orbits.
The exponent values obtained by our simulations
are listed in \reftab{tab:ks22pofl}.

Figures \ref{fig:UPOa2} and \ref{fig:UPOa}
show two approaching events with respect to \PO{10.25}
\footnote{
  Technical note:
  these approaching events are recorded from different trajectories,
  produced by slightly different codes.
  The 0th Fourier coefficient,
  or the spatial average of the dynamical variable $\int_0^L u(x) dx$,
  is randomly given for the trajectory used in \refFig{fig:UPOa2},
  while it is set to be 0 for the one used in \refFig{fig:UPOa}.
  Because the values of this conserved quantity can be arbitrarily changed
  by transformation $u'(x,t) \equiv u(x-ct,t)+c$,
  these two trajectories are merely two independent realizations
  of chaotic trajectories.
}.
The metric distance $d(t)$ between the chaotic trajectory $u(x,t)$
and the orbit $u_p(x,t)$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
  d(t)^2 \equiv \frac{1}{L}\int_0^L |u(x,t) - u_p(x+x_0, t+t_0)|^2 dx
  \label{eq:MetricDistance}
\end{equation}
with the values of $x_0$ and $t_0$ that minimize this distance
\footnote{
  In practice, the value of $t_0$ is chosen
  among multiples of the recording interval (about 0.2)
  used for the computation of the orbit.
  To determine $x_0$, we compare the complex coefficients
  of the Fourier mode of wave number $k$ closest to $1/\sqrt{2}$
  (which has the largest amplitude on average),
  $\tilde{u}(k,t)$ and $\tilde{u}_p(k,t)$,
  and choose such a value of $x_0$ that satisfies
  $\tilde{u}(k,t) = \tilde{u}_p(k,t) e^{ikx_0}$
  (hence the choice of $x_0$ is not discrete).
}.
Figures \ref{fig:UPOa2}(a) and \ref{fig:UPOa}(a) show
that the distance undergoes a local minimum within these time windows
and then increases at the rate of the largest Lyapunov exponent
of the orbit \PO{10.25}.

  \label{fig:UPOa}
\end{figure}%
At the moment of the shortest distance,
the snapshots of the trajectory $u(x,t)$
and the orbit $u_p(x+x_0,t+t_0)$
are indeed indistinguishable
[Figures \ref{fig:UPOa2}(c) and \ref{fig:UPOa}(c);
blue for the trajectory, red for the orbit].
To compare the CLVs $v^{(i)}(x,t)$ and $v_p^{(i)}(x+x_0,t+t_0)$,
while the comparison of the Floquet vectors associated with
real-valued Floquet multipliers is straightforward
[\reffig{fig:UPOa2}\,(e,f) and \reffig{fig:UPOa}\,(e,f)],
for the modes linked to complex conjugate Floquet multipliers,
we have to consider an arbitrary linear combination
of the two degenerate modes.
For example, since the first two modes of \PO{10.25}
correspond to a pair of complex conjugate Floquet multipliers,
we compare $v^{(1)}$ with $av_p^{(1)} + bv_p^{(2)}$
and choose the optimal choice of $a$ and $b$ that maximizes
the dot product $(v^{(1)}, av_p^{(1)} + bv_p^{(2)})$
[Figures \ref{fig:UPOa2}(c) and \ref{fig:UPOa}(c)].
The obtained results are somewhat perplexing:
for the event 1 shown in \refFig{fig:UPOa2},
all {\cLvs} from the trajectory
become more or less similar to the Floquet vectors from the orbit
[\reffig{fig:UPOa2}(d-f)]
regardless of the sign and multiplicity of LE,
but for the other event in \refFig{fig:UPOa},
some vectors are similar but others are not.
The situation can be seen at a glance
by plotting a matrix of the angle for arbitrary pairs of the vectors,
$\theta_{ij} \equiv \cos^{-1}|(v^{(i)}, v_p^{(j)})|$
[\reffig{fig:UPOa2}(g) and \reffig{fig:UPOa}(g);
note that the multiplicity is not taken into account here].
In this plot, we see which pairs of CLVs resemble each other
(dark blue = similar, red = different)
and find that some diagonal pairs (of the same Lyapunov index)
do not show good similarity, whereas similarity can sometimes be found
for off-diagonal pairs
(e.g., in \refFig{fig:UPOa}, the second mode of the trajectory becomes
rather similar to the sixth mode of the orbit).
Such correspondence can also be studied
by measuring finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) $\lambda_t^{(i)}$,
which are average of the instantaneous growth rate within a finite time window
around time $t$ (here the averaging period is set to be $2T_p$).
Figures \ref{fig:UPOa2}(b) and \ref{fig:UPOa}(b) compare
the FTLEs of the trajectory (color)
with the LEs of the orbit (horizontal lines).
We find that some FTLEs of the trajectory do not fluctuate much
and stay near one of the LEs of the orbit for a while.
For example, the second to fifth FTLEs stay near zero
during $0 < t' < 50$ [especially in \refFig{fig:UPOa}(b)],
though there are only three marginal modes in the KS system considered here.
Similarly, in \refFig{fig:UPOa}(b),
the ninth FTLE (magenda) stays near the nineth LE of the orbit
(lowest horizontal line) and the sixth to eighth FTLEs (yellow, black, brown)
stay near the sixth LE of the orbit (third horizontal line).
The first FTLE (blue) fluctuates around the first and second LE of the orbit
(conjugate pair).
The seventh and eighth LEs of the orbit (conjugate pair)
seem to have no partner among the FTLEs of the trajectory
in \refFig{fig:UPOa}(b),
but in \refFig{fig:UPOa2}(b) these LEs are approached
first by the eighth FTLE (brown), then by the seventh (black),
the ninth (magenta), and finally by the sixth and seventh (yellow and black),
though the correspondence is not always clear.
One may argue that some pairs of the vectors do not correspond well
because the distance between the trajectory and the orbit
is not sufficiently short: this may be true, but investigating
another event with much shorter distance
($d = 3 \times 10^{-3}$, which is shortest
during a trajectory of length $10^8$)
did not seem to improve the correspondence.

(the rest is to be updated)
