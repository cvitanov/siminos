\item[2013-03-21, 2014-01-21 PC]
I have copied this chapter from ChaosBook.org to here in order to get advice
from Kazamusa and Xiong Ding what I should incorporate as essential write up
of the Lyapunov vector computations; the text is already formatted so it
can be simply moved from here back to the ChaosBook.

To Xiong Ding: Please edit freely - you need to clearly define and
distinguish `Lyapunov' quantities from `dynamical' ones in your paper(s)
and the thesis, and for me this is the only chance this spring to bring
the Lyapunov chapter in ChaosBook up to date. I will not lecture on this
this year. Here is how to \Xiongedit{mark your edits}, and how to insert
footnotes\Xiong{2014-01-2}{A sample Xiong Ding footnote}.

\item[2014-03-03 PC] Nobody want to look critically at this, so I have
removed this chapter - the original is in  ChaosBook.org and easily fetched,
if there is a suden surge of interest...

our newly acquired tools to the fundamental diagnostics in
dynamics: Is a given system `chaotic'? And if so, how chaotic?
