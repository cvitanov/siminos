Work of H.~L. was fully supported by the family of late G. Robinson,
Jr..
No actual cats, graduate or undergraduate %, have shown interest in, or
were harmed during this research. This paper sets up the necessary
underpinnings for the quantum field theory of \catlatt, the details of
which we leave to our % always trustworthy
friends Jon Keating and Marcos Saraceno.
