In this article, we formulate a symmetry invariant representation for 
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system and visualize unstable manifolds of 
system's relative periodic orbits in this description. To the best of
our knowledge, both symmetry reduction scheme and visualization 
methods we present are novel. We believe that these techniques can
be useful in various studies of spatiotemporal chaos, in particular 
shear-flow turbulence.  

Yours sincerely,
