The set of all bi-infinite itineraries that can be formed from the
letters of the alphabet ${\cal A}$ is called the
{\em full shift} (or {\em topological Markov chain})
\index{shift!full}
\index{Markov!chain}\index{topological!Markov chain}
% before \ee{FullSh}

Here we refer to this set of all conceivable itineraries
as the {\em covering} symbolic dynamics.

Orbit that starts out as a finite {\brick} followed by infinite number of
repeats of another {\brick} $p = (\Ssym{1} \Ssym{2} \Ssym{3} \cdots
\Ssym{\period{}})$ is said to be {\em heteroclinic} to the cycle $p$. An
orbit that starts out as $p^{\infty}$ followed by a different finite
{\brick} followed by $(p')^{\infty}$ of another {\brick} $p'$ is said to be a
{\em heteroclinic connection} from cycle $p$ to cycle $p'$.
    \index{heteroclinic!connection}



Suppose that
the grammar can be stated as a finite number of pruning rules, each
forbidding a {\brick} of finite length,
\index{symbolic dynamics!coding}
\beq
 {\cal G} = \left\{
        b_1, b_2, \cdots b_k
        \right\}
\,,
\ee{grammar}
where a {\em pruned {\brick}} $b$ is a sequence of symbols
$b=\block{ \Ssym{1} \Ssym{2} \cdots \Ssym{\cl{b}}}$,
 $\Ssym{} \in {\cal A}$,
of finite length $\cl{b}$.

\noindent{\bf Subshifts of finite type.}
A {topological dynamical system} $(\Sigma,\sigma)$ for
which all {\admissible} itineraries are generated by a finite
transition matrix
\beq
\Sigma = \left\{ (\Ssym{k})_{k\in \integers} \,:\, T_{s_k s_{k+1}} = 1
        \quad \mbox{for all $k$} \right\}
\ee{AdmItnr}
is called a subshift of {\em finite type}.
