\subsection{Integrating \KSe\ numerically} \label{sec:fourierRLD}

    {Use what needed from this {\bf SCD07}\rf{SCD07} section in the numerical
     methods text (somewhere close to \refsect{sect:variational}), then remove.}
    %
The \KSe\ in terms of spatial Fourier modes:
\beq
  \hat{u}_k = {\cal F}[u]_k
  = \frac{1}{\speriod{}}\int_0^\speriod{} u(\conf,\zeit) e^{-i q_kx}dx\,,
  \qquad u(\conf,\zeit) = {\cal F}^{-1}[\hat{u}] =
  \sum_{k\in{\mathbb Z}} \hat{u}_k \, e^{i q_k x}
\eeq
is given by
\beq
  \dot{\hat{u}}_k = \left(q_k^2-q_k^4\right) \hat{u}_k -
  \frac{i q_k}{2}{\cal F}[({\cal F}^{-1}[\hat{u}])^2]_k\,.
\eeq
Since $u$ is real, the Fourier modes are related by $\hat{u}_{-k} =
\hat{u}^\ast_k$.

The above system is truncated as follows:
\beq
  a_k = {\cal F}_N[u]_k = \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} u(x_n)
  e^{-i q_k x_n}\,,\qquad u(x_n) = {\cal F}_N^{-1}[a]_n
  = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k = 0}^{N-1} a_k e^{i q_k x_n}\,,
\eeq
where $x_n = \speriod{}/N$ and $a_{N-k} = a^\ast_k$.  Since $a_0
= 0$ due to Galilean invariance and setting $a_{N/2} = 0$ (assuming
$N$ is even), the number of independent variables in the truncated
system is $N-2$:
\beq
  \dot{a}_k = \pVeloc_k(a) = \left(q_k^2-q_k^4\right)a_k -
  \frac{i q_k}{2}{\cal F}_N[({\cal F}_N^{-1}[a])^2]_k\,,
\ee{eq:KS}
where $k = 1,\ldots,N/2-1$, although in the Fourier transform we need
to use $a_k$ over the full range of $k$ values from 0 to $N-1$.
As $a_k \in \mathbb{C}$, \refeq{eq:KS} represents a
system of ordinary differential equations in ${\mathbb R}^{N-2}$.

The discrete Fourier transform ${\cal F}_N$ is computed by
FFT\rf{Frigo05}.
